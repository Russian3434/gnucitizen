		<description>It&#039;s scary how many are blinded by what the media tells us to be the truth and the only way of life.

Eventually and hopefully more of us will wake up and do something about it. Or at least speak up against it so the rest of the followers will start to question why they are doing things without giving it a single thought.</description>

		<description>I agree to an extend. My philosophy is that everything is in circulation. What was once old will become new and vice-versa.</description>

		<description>That&#039;s not the whole truth. Monoculture is mostly skin deep, inside we live with our idiosyncrasies and weirdness. Actually the weird will become mainstream, this whole notion of counterculture will die in a couple of decades. It&#039;s only a matter of time before this generation of internet junkies become the ones in charge of everything.

BTW the music is part of The Fight Club soundtrack, and transmet rules.</description>
