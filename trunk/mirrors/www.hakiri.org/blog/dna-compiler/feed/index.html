		<description>kewl guys! I was spellbound, and my DNA rearranged for a second show - &quot;WOW&quot; before they were back on track.
My pin point is where it is starting and where it gonna lead us? Nutshell, what is the driving force behind it &amp; where it gonna lead us .oO(I hope just not DNA design &amp; graphics)</description>

		<description>writing the actual language for constructing the DNA sequences is trivial, as long as we understand what these sequences mean :)</description>

		<description>Wow.. i never tought I&#039;m gonna read my name on this sites.. I feel honored. Anyway, there already is some sort of gui to &quot;design bacteria&quot;: also fatured in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/227&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt;, it seems pretty drag-and-drop designing your microbe basing on predefined modules.

But it would be nice to have a possibility to actually write a program without being bound to this gui/modules. Creating a DNA programming language shure would be a fun thing! Maybe someone could extend the idea to write some sort of &quot;genetic operating system&quot;, so that coding dna could be even simpler and much more fun. Ican already hear the geeks trying to port Linux on Microbes ;D</description>
