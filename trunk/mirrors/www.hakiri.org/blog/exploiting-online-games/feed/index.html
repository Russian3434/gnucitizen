		<description>I truly believe that we have reached the point where technology has become one with our lives, and I can say with 99% certainty that we have passed the point of no return in our relationship with technology.I don&#039;t mean this in a bad way, of course! Ethical concerns aside... I just hope that as technology further innovates, the possibility of copying our brains onto a digital medium becomes a true reality. It&#039;s one of the things I really wish I could experience in my lifetime.(Submitted using SysBro for R4i Nintendo DS.)</description>

		<description>Shocking post,

This computer games addiction is a way for the person to escape from their regular life in the real world to the world of fantasy where they achieve more control of their social relationships in the virtual reality realm than in real relationships. While there is no quick, overnight cure for computer games addiction parents can limit their child&#039;s exposure to video games, especially the more violent ones. Their simple rule can minimize media&#039;s potentially harmful effects on their child/children.</description>
