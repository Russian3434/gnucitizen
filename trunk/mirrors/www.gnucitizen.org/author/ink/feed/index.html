			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Black Hat Europe 2008, which took place in Amsterdam, we&#8217;ve got a lot of attention around what is Black PR and what exactly we have to do with it. A few media outlets covered some of the details around our expertise in this area although their point of view was, well, slightly distorted from the reality. Therefore, with this post we would like to clarify the basics of Black PR and PR Security business and also explain how it is integrated within our group.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with a bit of explanation. The following is an excerpt from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>Black Public Relations (BPR) or negative PR is a process of destroying someone&#8217;s reputation and corporate identity. In other words, instead of concentrating your efforts in the maintenance and the creation of a positive reputation/ image of your clients, you are trying to discredit someone&#8217; else (usually your business rivals). Unlike the regular services in Public Relations, those in BPR rely on the development of industries such as IT security, industrial espionage, social engineering and competitive intelligence. Their main objective is finding all of the dirty secrets of their target and turning them against their very own holder. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_PR" title="Wikipedia: Black Public Relations (Black PR)">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>

<p>In summary, BPR is all about professional smear strategies, industrial espionages, propaganda and information hacking because data accessibility is crucial for every BPR campaign. Now let&#8217;s move on and see how this is related to what we do.</p>

<p>As you are probably aware, GNUCITIZEN is not flat. The GNUCITIZEN umbrella unites several other organizations which operate independently and are equal in size and importance. <a href="http://www.spinhunters.org" title="Spin Hunters | Social Hacking Research House ">Spin Hunters</a>, the Social Hacking Research House, is one of the few organizations/companies worldwide that deal with Public Relations Security (PR Security), exclusively. Spin Hunter&#8217;s main objective is to provide information on the wide range of black pr threats. In a way, Spin Hunters is to black pr, as GNUCITIZEN is to information security. This means, that when you read the Spin Hunter&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spinhunters.org/categories/blog/" title="Spin Hunter's blog">blog</a> you will become more aware of what black public relations is and also learn how to detect and counter-attack bpr, smear campaigns, etc. In fact, Spin Hunters is mostly about detection and protection. We wont do BPR for you, so don&#8217;t waste yours or our time.</p>

<p>Spin Hunters and GNUCITIZEN work together on a few levels. First of all, in order to detect or prevent BPR we have to perform a few deep analysis of the situation. This also involves things such as identifying information security vulnerabilities and attack vectors because as I mentioned before, data is a crucial asset. The GNUCITIZEN tiger team is mostly involved with that stage. Once information is obtained, the black pr experts and pr security analysts provide consulting about how all identified attack vectors can be used in order to damage the client&#8217;s reputation. By saying <q>attack vectors</q>, I refer to the class of vulnerabilities which are not only hi-tech related but also has to do with other things such as propaganda, social engineering, business intelligence, etc.</p>

<p>In short, we don&#8217;t do Black PR. We do PR Security. Spin Hunters is primary involved with providing information on current Black PR threats and counter-strategies. GNUCITIZEN is involved with providing information on security threats and counter-attacks. Spin Hunters and GNUCITIZEN work together on several levels &#8211; as a think tank, tiger team and a consulting bureau. Therefore, the claim that we are going to counter-attack companies that try to hide security vulnerabilities is false and shows that there is a significant lack of understandings on the essence of black pr and pr security. Nevertheless, the Black PR and PR Security field is huge and the more you are aware of these practices the more you realize that they are effectively used on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>---<br/>recent posts from the gnucitizen network:</p><p><a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2012/05/websecurify-websuite-incidents-php-cgi.html">Websecurify Websuite Incidents (PHP-CGI, CVE-2012-2311)</a><br/><a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2012/05/websuite-scanner-tutorial.html">Websuite Scanner Tutorial</a><br/><a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2012/05/this-is-how-we-code.html">This is How We Code</a><br/><a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2012/05/retro-websecurify-v04-video.html">Retro Websecurify (v0.4) Video</a><br/><a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2012/05/websuite-scanner-preview-video.html">Websuite Scanner Preview Video</a><br/></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been trying to expose our thoughts about the fundamental ethical issues in the industry for a quite a long time. The truth is that it is not very simple to define what a righteous hacking is or which is the best way to deal with discovered vulnerabilities. Moreover, we do realize that having this talk is also very subjective and has different meanings to everyone. In the past couple of months, GNUCITIZEN has increased its rank dramatically and became key topic of many media outlets. Our popularity and running activities have constantly challenged us to reconsider our professional virtues and to seek the answers of the major industrial dilemmas. So in the spirit of upcoming festivals, it seems practically fitting for GNUCITIZEN to devote some time reflecting on the year&#8217;s past and talk about where we find ourselves as the New Year dawns. Here is our top five list of Year-End ethical questions:</p>

<h3>1. What did we learn?</h3>

<p>GNUCITIZEN is an ethical, white-hat organization that doesn&#8217;t hide anything. We strongly believe that knowledge belongs to everyone and we make everything to ensure that our readers have access to the latest cutting-edge research and get alerted of the newest security threats when they come. Our experience shows that the best way of protection is actually mass information. And we mean that literally!!! It is in the public&#8217;s best interest to make our findings accessible to vast majority of people, simply because it is proven that the more people know about a certain problem, the better. Yes, sometimes the bad guys can use the information in unethical ways but this is a calculated risk which we, as a society, can afford to take.</p> 

<h3>2. What did we accomplish?</h3>

<p>We avoid to think about our achievements in numbers and tables, simply because we believe that the greater satisfaction in life comes when you feel that the things you do are worthy and meaningful. GNUCITIZEN is not some weird laboratory of creating exploits, but a place where everyone can find the best solutions and awareness of numerous security risks. Usually when we talk about vulnerabilities and hacking, we are trying to consider the attacks in much broader context. We are trying to look beyond their technical aspects and predict the ways that they can affect the other parts of the system. And if some of you think of us very darkly it is just because every single member of our team has the guts to name the things the way they are.</p> 

<h3>3. What would we have done differently?</h3>

<p>If there is something that we really regret is the proportion between Web app and other types of research we&#8217;ve published during this year. Looking back in the past couple of months is also easy to see that the sensational elements slightly dominate over the quality of our content. I am not saying that we are consciously pursuing some kind of a fame, but sometimes the way we express our self is a bit shocking for such a young and small professional community as ours. We also believe that integration, not differentiation, is the path everyone must take in order to increase the excellence of security services. And this means more personal involvement, public discussions and challenged creativity.</p>

<h3>4. What were the most significant events of the year&#8217;s past?</h3>

<p>We have done a lot of <q>pocking around</q> across many sectors of our industry. Unfortunately, you have heard of the ones that we could afford to made public. We have concentrated most of our efforts and time on exposing client-side security issues and also investigating methodologies of how to penetrate various embedded devices and we believe that we were successful in these on many, many levels. Looking back, we cannot omit our achievements on bringing the <q>hacking mindset</q> to the masses with what we would like to refer to as the <q>GNUCITIZEN sessions</q>. We have also done well with establishing the Black Public Relation (blackpr, bpr) security practices in London. We find this a great achievement and something that worths to be improved on in the future.</p>

<h3>5. How are we going to be different next year?</h3>

<p>When we started the group a couple of months ago, we were not quite sure what exactly we want to achieve in the future. To be honest with you, the only thing we knew at that time was what kind of a vision we were willing to avoid. We wanted to create a space, where you won&#8217;t read our interpretation of already existing news or be bored with personal stories of our modest lives. We wanted to show you that hacking is not just some kind of illegal craft, but an ancient art and a state of mind. Just like the martial arts, in order to protect yourself you need to predict in advance your enemy&#8217;s moves, you need to choose the right tools and define the perfect moment not to attack but to save your most valuable assets.</p>

<p>Driven by our favorite mantra <q>hacking is a lifestyle</q>, the GNUCITIZEN group has significantly expanded its team and added several new affiliates to its core body like Hakiri, Securls and Spin Hunters. We had the pleasure to have as a guest bloggers some of the greatest <q>samurais</q> in the industry and had the nastiest comments and personal remarks you can ever imagine. We hope that we will continue doing that during the next year as well. It has been only an year since we started GNUCITIZEN. Babies start walking after their first year. We expect to have more interesting stuff coming up for the future and of course, have a lot more troubles because of them, but it is within us to tackle whatever obstacles we have ahead of us and move forward.</p>
