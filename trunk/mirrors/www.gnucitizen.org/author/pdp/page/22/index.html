<p>The Universal PDF XSS issue was discovered by Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon and it was presented on 23C3 security conference. This vulnerability obviously affects the Adobe Acrobat Reader which is a widely used software among business, non-business organizations and individuals. [...]</p>

<p>105 million sites make their home on the Web &#8211; 4 million more move in each month. Thatâ€™s a staggering number to think about, and as we well know, the vast majority of websites (I say 8 in 10) have serious security issues. Industry discussions go round and round about what should be done. We talk about secure coding practices, training, compliance, assessment, source-code audits, and the like. [...]</p>
