	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>I am heavily frustrated from the way the Web works today. Everything seems to be broken beyond reason. I really want to fix the damn thing but I realize that it is not up to me to do that. It is up to all of us to make sure that code is written in the most secure possible way. Can we do that? Perhaps not! What can we do then?</p>
<p>Before I get to the point, I need to tell you how I fixed my insecure WordPress blog. [...]</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>I would like to share a few thoughts on the notion of being in direct control of your environment. This article is a continuation from my previous one and it aims to justify why nowadays individuals and organizations prefer to give away control in order to gain more agility. Needless to say, less control is often equal to less security.</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>Over the weekend I had time to read some great books on economics and as such and I&#8217;ve become more aware of a phenomenon known as the Pareto Principle or the 80/20 rule.</p>
<p>Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who was living and working during the 19th century. During his career he had discovered a law of nature which was later known as the 80/20 rule. The rule simply states that for many events, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. [...]</p>
