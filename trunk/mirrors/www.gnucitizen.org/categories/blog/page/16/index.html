	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>Leaving your WiFi network open is not a good idea. Bruce Schneier does not agree and wrote an interesting article. The following is an extract of it:</p>
<p>Although Bruce is making some good points regarding the smaller likelihood of being attacked via wifi at home as opposed to a public place, he makes one mistake: he assumes the attack will be an attempt to compromise his PC/laptop or eavesdrop his traffic. Of course these are valid attacks, but how about attacking his router? [...]</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>It&#8217;s known that UPnP is inherently insecure for a very simple reason: administrative tasks can be performed on a Internet Gateway Device (IGD) without needing to know the admin password whatsoever! This on its own is quite scary and I personally feel that although there is some research in the public domain, there is much more attention that needs to be paid to UPnP.</p>
<p>UPnP allows you to perform administrative functions. Some functions are very standardized and supported by most devices. [...]</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>During last month, just around the holiday festivals, Adrian and I did some investigation about potential uses and abuses of the so called UPnP (Universal Plug and Play). The reason why we started playing with this particular technology was mainly due to an urge to discover other creative ways to break into embedded devices. What we have discovered was not necessarily new but rather interesting and very, very intriguing. [...]</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>We have been trying to expose our thoughts about the fundamental ethical issues in the industry for a quite a long time. The truth is that it is not very simple to define what a righteous hacking is or which is the best way to deal with discovered vulnerabilities. Moreover, we do realize that having this talk is also very subjective and has different meanings to everyone. In the past couple of months, GNUCITIZEN has increased its rank dramatically and became key topic of many media outlets. [...]</p>

I personally find that perfectly fine and ethical since you need people from both camps. Not, that we are the bad guys, (we are whitehats) but we primarily concentrate on how to break things.
