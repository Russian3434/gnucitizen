		<description>I spend a lot of my time doing maintenance on computers that have complacent operators. Especially with your home computer it is wise to check for updates for all your drivers and software once a weak. Daily if you really want to keep up on it. It will save you money if you don&#039;t know how to fix your computer once its malfunctioning.</description>

		<description>This article actually brings up a few good points, which goes beyond just ensuring your browser is patched.
It only proves the point: No matter how far you go out of your way to make something idiot proof, someone will find a way to build a better idiot.

Mistyping a url can be a disaster for anyone who isn&#039;t paying attention to what they are doing. Imagine having to make a payment online. You&#039;ve procrastinated to the last moment. Instead of using the computer at home where you have it bookmarked, you use the computer at work. You casually type in the url and wha-la the familar page pops up and you type in your information, enter your payment and press enter. A few seconds later you get a confirmation screen or not... it doesn&#039;t matter... you already sent your data to the wrong url which you mistyped.

It was quite easy for someone at www.myban.com to copy the data from www.mybank.com to his url. He only needs to be successful once.

As security professionals, we need to try to protect our users from malicious websites as well as our systems. This has a double affect though, since many of these malicious sites, will also try to send something back into our systems with the user. 

What can we do? Usually the best angle of defense here would be with a proxy server. Collect a list of most frequently hit web sites, then come up with some common mis-spellings for each. Simply block at the proxy server. Looks like you&#039;ve already learned Google mis-spellings is a good start!

One last hint: If you want to be a Spelling Nazi. Ensure your grammar is top notch. Things like... not begining a sentence with the word, &quot;And&quot; or misusing a comma. Might make you look bad!</description>

		<description>Nice video :-).

It&#039;s all about Windows and IE.

And guys try to not misspell google.com. For example, I use google.com.ua and usually use my internal Mozilla&#039;s search functions (with selected Google search engine).

And by the way, pdp, &quot;misspell&quot; with double &quot;s&quot; ;-).

P.S.

Gnucitizen.org has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

:-D</description>

		<description>I only had a WinXP SP2 vm laying around. There are no patches beyond the default SP2 install CD install. Sorry to disappoint, but it didn&#039;t work for me. That means IF it is using any exploits they can not have been released in the last year or so. Yes the site hosts pop-up ads, and after I said to allow all popup ads from the site I got ONE, but nothing else happened. It&#039;s possible when the video was made that one of the ads itself was hosting malicious content, but still... someone else needs to actually try and verify this since I doubt it very very much (I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t sites out there like that, it&#039;s my job to find them, I&#039;m just saying that this is just normal typo-squatting by a normal ad service)</description>
