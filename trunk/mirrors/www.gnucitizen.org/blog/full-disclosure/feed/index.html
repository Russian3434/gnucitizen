		<description>Nokia, what you saying is why Full Disclosure came about in the first place really. Researchers got tired of companies pushing their findings aside. In a large way, FD has really helped push the information security industry forward.</description>

		<description>Do you alter your thoughts on this dependant on the company/organisation/domain in question?

I recently strongly hinted to a well known organisation about a flaw they had with one of their pages; I didn&#039;t receive so much as a thank you in reply - however the flaw was patched in less that 3 hours, which was quite impressive.

The company employs people for this very reason and probably pays them a pretty decent wage....I now take the stance [for this company] that if the folks they are paying can not secure their own set-up and if they are no going to at least appear grateful when someone tells them for fee, then I won&#039;t inform them about anything I may discover on their domain in the future - I won&#039;t inform anyone else but I certainly won&#039;t inform them.</description>
