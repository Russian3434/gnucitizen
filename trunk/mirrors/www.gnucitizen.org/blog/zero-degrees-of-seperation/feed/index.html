		<description>Everybody above me --their views on this critical issue of is too simplistic. I am talking about the seriousness of seperation--between one human being from another. We are here at thic global village called earth or planet. Why in the world Indo-Europeans like to seperate themselves from other groups--other ethnic groups. From my understanding--very positively we are human beings are interconnected--interwoven. Everything is the same--except artificial areas of our lives.Green eyes, blue eyes, black hair, brown hair--and so forth. The human sepration has become a catastrophy. It has enabled us to develop weapons of mass detruction. We can decimate  human race-the whole people on earth with our deadly madness--weapons. What is the deal? We are brothers and sisters. Pass the cookies.</description>

		<description>Vincent,

thanks. From the attacker&#039;s prospective, it doesn&#039;t really matter whether their victim knows them. All they care is that in the virtual world there is only one step (as you pointed in your respond) that separates them. This means, that if the attacker gains control of the communication medium, they will also be able to get closer to their victim.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, the answer is zero. Between me and Paris there are no other steps just like between me and you, the reader&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First of all, the answer isn&#039;t zero. The only person at zero step from you is yourself - each person you know is one step away from you. So, maybe, it would be one step.

Second, you&#039;re drawing shortcuts where there&#039;s none. The arcs in the graph of connectedness are about knowledge. People you know and that know you. The latter is important - we all &quot;know&quot; the President, or major stars, or socialite Paris Hilton. Does that mean we have only a single step in the connection graph? No. Because the President, or Ms Hilton doesn&#039;t know you.

The social web system is a wonderful tool to densify the connection graph. But the mere existence of a page doesn&#039;t create an arc in it - its use creates one. To have an arc connecting us, it would take discussion (by posting this, I am creating the arc... assuming you read it).

If you accept directed, non reciprocal arcs, then yes, Ms Hilton is one step from you. But then, how many steps are you from her?</description>

		<description>Whats even stranger to me, is that I can have a closer connection to someone famous, than with some of my old friends. Having graduated ten years before any of the online social networking took off, many friends don&#039;t have myspace, but paris hilton does. 

In our bizarre society, its more socially acceptable to approach a celebrity I&#039;ve never met, than some one I used to go to school with. There is a diminished expectation of privacy with celebs. I think all celebs are o degrees of separation from everyone, but us mortals are still 6 degrees form each other.</description>

		<description>Steven, yes, I agree. However, the web greatly reduces the necessary steps. Between you and any other person on this planet there are a number of routers which will put you though the next node as long as you provide a valid destination address. In case of the web, you have a particular site that separates you from that other person. Knowing how subjective to abuse web technologies are, this, in general, is a quite scary thought.</description>

		<description>Also keep in mind what you might perceive to be zero degrees of separation might actually be closer to six.  Not every blog, *official* website, or social networking page for a particular individual or organization may be legitimate or truly run by them.  In some cases a publicist may be running the website.  In others it&#039;s just a lunatic with nothing better to do.  With that you quickly go reach six degres of separation.</description>
