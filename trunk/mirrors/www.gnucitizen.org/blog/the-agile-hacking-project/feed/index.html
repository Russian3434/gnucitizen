		<description>yeh... I agree. It was a stupid decision to call it V2. I&#039;ve got some cool names and we might end up using them. Will see how it goes. Still, if somebody has good ideas, please let us know. Your help is much appreciated.</description>

		<description>Oh thats fine, I was more poking fun at the few users that I have seen on there. Yeah they are their, yeah they are in the minority, and hopefully they will learn, and contribute, or leave. Yeah it is tough coming up with names sometimes, I was just thinking v2 leant itself more to being a new version, a replacement.</description>

		<description>Hi Morgon. There is no reason for calling it V2. It just came to me and I though that this is a good code name. I have already informed the HoH community that I am looking for better names and I am open to suggestions. In fact, I am really hoping that the community will come up with the name as this is yet another community project.

As for HoH, yes there are some people that do not belong there but we will either try to make them behave or essentially ban them from the network. But it is an open network so everybody have the right to express themselves as long as a few ethical principles are followed.</description>

		<description>PDP the wiki looks good, but why call it V2 I thought you were being exclusionnary to all the little script kiddies that have infiltrated HoH as of late.</description>
