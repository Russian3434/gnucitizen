		<description>@Giorgio Maone: let me see... thanks for your understanding, responsible disclosure MEANS that &quot;it WAS big&quot;, if not it&#039;s not responsible disclosure.</description>

		<description>Lovely example, but I wouldn&#039;t necessarily get too crazy on making the Nintendo Wii crash as it&#039;s easily done simply browsing normal pages. This is a pretty cool idea though seeing as how most services now use Flash players supporting the FLV file format, and generally use some shotty script to get the URL of the media from a variable in the address.</description>

		<description>@Stefano: 
I agree on the impact of slow patch deployment on mobile devices, and I&#039;ve been already contacted for some NoScript portings, actually.

Again thanks for the responsible disclosure and for your detailed and enjoyable advisory.

		<description>Giorgio, Stefano is right. It will take some time to upgrade all flash instances. So, the bug is very serious. In fact, I am sure that someone will take it and make into a worm of some sort. BTW, 10x to Stefano and his team responsible disclosure the impact is a lot less significant.

Stefano, always. The research is worthed.</description>

		<description>@Giorgio, 
even if there&#039;s a Flash player/plugin new version think about wii or smart phones with flash lite installed....
when vendors will fix it with an update?
 
@Pdp, thank for you kind words and for this blog entry!:)</description>

		<description>OK, I had a chance to watch the Symantec video and finally realized how really scary this bug was.

The video starts with &quot;Example 1: Windows with Firefox&quot;, but even before they open the compromised FLV, the attack has already transformed Firefox into Internet Explorer 6 for better exploitation, OMG!!!

		<description>Giorgio,

you are right. Never the less I though it might be a good idea to mention the bug and also point out where the credits are due. :)</description>

		<description>Not to play the devil&#039;s advocate, but &quot;it WAS big&quot;.

Stefano and Giorgio did responsible disclosure, thus the Flash Player plugin registered in my default Firefox profile (version 9.0r47) is not vulnerable.

Since, let me see... July 10th 2007... 13 days now?

Anyway Minded Security&#039;s advisory is very worth reading, many thanks for the pointer :)
