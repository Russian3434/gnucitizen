		<description>Actually, it&#039;s not necessarily the webserver that has to be compromised/infected. A proxy server would certainly be a more powerful attack base. Actually, I developed an &quot;in-line&quot; browser exploit years ago, which could be deployed in an internal network, working as a proxy for all outgoing http request (if needed, after executing a MITM attack to redirect the network stream). I injected the exploit only once for a certain (or all) websites, that way the user or administrator could be compromised even if he/she only surfed &quot;trustworthy&quot; sites. Of course, compromising a proxy is alway a major security breach, but I think injecting malicious mobile code certainly multiplies the amount of attackable clients. Of course, that way the attacker does not have to make use of an IFRAME anymore. 
I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if proxy servers become more and more the aim of large-scale attacks very soon.</description>

		<description>Yep I am very familiar with that as iframe&#039;s have been used for exploits for years now.  I just find it funny that the same old things get recycled and treated as new.  I guess it&#039;s good for those that might have missed it or didn&#039;t get it before.</description>

		<description>steven, precisely,

the iframe in this case is a 0width 0height window/frame that downloads any exploit within the browser context without moving the user away from the current view. This is very sneaky since the user doesn&#039;t really know what is going on, unless they follow the messages inside the status bar.</description>

		<description>I think I am actually going to write something about this soon as I keep hearing it over and over.  There isn&#039;t really an &quot;iframe&quot; exploit.  Someone might make a virtually-invisible iframe reference to another page that houses exploit code, however, this is not an exploit with iframes.  If you&#039;re running unpatched software (and usually as an administrator) , that is why you got owned.  Te iframe is simply how they pulled in the exploit code from the third party site.</description>
