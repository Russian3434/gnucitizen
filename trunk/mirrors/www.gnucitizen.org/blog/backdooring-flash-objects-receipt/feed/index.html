		<description>above you say allowscriptaccess=&quot;never&quot; kills your POC but javascript isn&#039;t nessecary , you can do with with purse ActionScript...isn&#039;t there also a tag allowNetworking=&quot;internal&quot; would cover this... just wondering if I&#039;m missing something in your response..not trying to be a dick.</description>

		<description>Primitive javascript access - within the confines of the browsers security restrictions, can hardly be classified as &quot;system resources&quot;. If it were, then you could say you have access to the &quot;system resources&quot; of me, and anyone else who visits this site. By your logic, the following is a VBScript backdoor in a batch file

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@echo off
echo msgbox &quot;foo&quot; &gt; bar.vbs
start bar.vbs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

		<description>shizkani,
the short answer is &quot;NO&quot;, unless you use something like the IE VML vulnerability.

		<description>Definitely,

I would like to see your malware. I won&#039;t be able to attend these conferences but I will be vary happy to get some of your slides.

I am also working on some advance techniques that will go into AttackAPI and my blog quite soon.</description>

I love what you are doing so please keep up the good work. For far too long people have thought that JavaScript is a toy language and that XSS can only annoy and steal the occasional cookie. I applaud the work you have been doing.

Acidus,

ps: I&#039;m going to be dropping some JavaScript malware 0day in a week of back to back conferences (Toorcon-Ajax World-Security Opus) that I thhink you will find interesting...</description>

		<description>Well, then my POC won&#039;t work. It is that simple. However, keep in mind that JavaScript access is not required. Flash objects can be backdoored with ActionScript quite successfully and the attacker is given the same level accessibility; sometimes even more.</description>

		<description>There are no stupid questions.

I don&#039;t think that there is simple way of protecting against media file malware. Of course the most obvious approach will be to disable or filter out embed an object tags. However, this will make MySpace pages highly unattractive because people won&#039;t be able to show their YouTube movies for example.

Yeh, I might think about favicon. Why not?</description>

		<description>&quot;First of all, wrapping your malicious code inside flash files will bypass all XSS filtering systems (...)&quot;

Hadn&#039;t thought about that. It&#039;s clear for me now, thanks for the fast explanation. Actually after thinking a bit about it was a really dumb question.

So how can websites like myspace protect them selfs from being hijacked by an &#039;infected&#039; swf? (i&#039;m not a user from my space but i think they allow the use of SWFs in users accounts). Time to read how you managed to do it with quicktime.

PS: Stupid suggestion, can you get a favicon? I would like to have it on my bookmark.</description>
