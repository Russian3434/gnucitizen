		<description>How many worthwhile targets are boxes that someone would be running a browser on at all? 

Honestly, as far as I can tell, the most interesting thing here is that java will run stuff with strange extensions. Which could be interesting, seeing as Netscape will automatically download files that it doesn&#039;t recognize an extension for.

No matter what, this seems to be worthless without some form of social engineering. And there are already plenty of nasty things you can do if you can get someone to point a browser at your website.</description>

		<description>[...] The GIFAR issue was found by security researchers Billy Rios and Nate Mcfeters. To summarize the exploit, an attacker uploads a malicious image with embedded jar content on a target domain. This malicious image opens in any image viewer correctly and so it bypasses any content validation engine used by a web application. Then an attacker references this malicious image in the applet code on his or her evil site, establishing a cross-domain communication channel with the target domain. This attack is very serious because it breaks the Same Origin Policy principle. Also, this problem is not just confined to images, it is applicable to other file types such as doc, etc. Another great writeup on Jar File Issues is on pdp&#8217;s blog. [...]</description>

		<description>No one seems to have noticed Dave&#039;s feedback. If you base your security on ip addresses... well... I know many people do just that, but it still is quite stupid. An IP address is an attribute of some machine on a network, which is quite different from a secure credential identifying some user. There could be a lot of users behind the same IP, a user could use multiple computers from different locations and still should have legit access... So, it isn&#039;t a safe, secure and flexible way of identifying users.</description>

		<description>Mihai, none of the libraries that I&#039;ve tested which check whether an uploaded blob is a valid issue has detected the malicious JAR attached. This is the fact. But if you don&#039;t believe me, go and do some experiments on your own.

I think that you misunderstood the post.</description>

		<description>I think you missed the point that bug made. The friggin&#039; applet still executes within the client. It doesn&#039;t suddenly acquire server priviledges. You&#039;d have to spawn a virtual machine on the server machine and have a class run in it, that&#039;s the kind of support your applet would need in order to poke around. Yeah, they talk about that on the web -- if an applet requires connecting to something other than its originating host, some process on the server must help it. You&#039;re confusing some unrelated concepts here.

If you seem to think that this upload-then-run-me issue is some sort of an Achile&#039;s heel, well, it is not. Simple sanitizing techniques in your file uploading should do the trick. Check out the bugtraq lists every now and then.</description>

		<description>This is utter rubbish, you can&#039;t learn anything about the server (the jar is executed on the client NOT the server. If the applet did try and probe the server from the client, you couldn&#039;t learn anything you could more simply learn by just running a port scanning tool) and the Java sand-box stops the applet on the client machine probing the client machine. 

If you are suggesting you get someone on the server side to run the applet, whoopie do, the applet still can&#039;t pass that information on as it can&#039;t connect to anything other than itself. 

I&#039;m sorry, this is total nonsense.</description>
