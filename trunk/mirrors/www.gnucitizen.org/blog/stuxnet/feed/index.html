		<description>Very pretty.  I will happily sit through almost anything that had some good dynamic text stuff going on.  I also haven&#039;t really dug into Stuxnet to find out what&#039;s real and what isn&#039;t, but if everything mentioned in that video is verifiable, then I think we&#039;re in a new phase of &quot;weponized software.&quot;

Also, ouch.  Wouldn&#039;t want to be RealTek or Siemens after watching that video.</description>
