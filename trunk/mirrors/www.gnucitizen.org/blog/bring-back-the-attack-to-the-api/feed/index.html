		<description>And what about Technika API. Is there any chance, that it would be associable with Firefox 3.x platform?</description>

		<description>I started a project named &quot;Anehta&quot; on Google Code. Which is a xss attack platform.It contains a javascript file called &quot;anehta.js&quot; which had implemented most of the attackAPI&#039;s feature. I call my project a &quot;platform&quot; but not &quot;framework&quot; because I use PHP to implement some server-side features.So it&#039;s more than what attackAPI is.

You can visit my project here: http://anehta.googlecode.com

The version under developing is 0.6.0 and have a better UI.

I wrote some documents on my blog: http://hi.baidu.com/aullik5 

and some demo videos here: http://hi.baidu.com/aullik5/blog/item/cb4cd5899283b093a4c272a9.html

but I didn&#039;t have enough time to translate docs into English , so all the docs are in Chinese at the moment. This work may be done later. In my plan, I will write some flash AS, java applet or something else to implement more powerful features. If you have some advise, feel free to write to me.</description>
