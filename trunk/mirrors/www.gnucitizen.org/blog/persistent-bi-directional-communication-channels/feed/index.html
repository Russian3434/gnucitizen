		<description>[...] Using the techniques such as persistent channels, backdoors in QuickTime, backdoors in Flash, backdoors in PDF, backdoors in RealMedia and backdoors in RSS feeds in conjunction with splogs one can achieve quite a lot. Sometimes I even scare myself when I start thinking more deeply about this problem. Moreover, I know that the process can be automated. Every flash file the sploger downloads can be altered; every sound, backdoored; every image, changed. It is not a war between the humans and the machines. It is a war between us and ourselves only.

		<description>Brad, very good point. I have a few more things to finish before going into this issue. I get the feeling that it is possible but than again I&#039;ve been wrong before, so you are right: the theory might not work in practice. Let&#039;s see.</description>

		<description>Hi Brad,

I am planning to write hacked version of Flash Storage model soon. In this article I am presenting the technique and the theory behind it. Of course that is not sufficient.

Soon there will be an examples as well and I am planning to do this in the 0.9 release of AttackAPI. Thanks for the comment.</description>

		<description>This is interesting but I&#039;d like to see an actual working example. My Dojo Storage flash code, for example, must be invoked and loaded on page load since it depends on a document.write; I&#039;m not sure if a dynamic SCRIPT tag could invoke it and set it up. If the original domain already has Dojo Storage or the given flash file then that is one thing, but what if it doesn&#039;t?</description>
