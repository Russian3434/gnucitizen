		<description>[...] I believe that this spider is a lot more stable then what JIKTO is using. Why? It is like that because the core component of JIKTO was the same origin unification hack which was initially described here. I repeat, it is a hack. By using a proper mashup service, we do not relay on hacks any more, we use actual service side components that can be scribed via client side technologies. In general, we can use publicly available services for their processing power and more over, we can use them in a distributed way and this is what is dangerous about them. I can talk on this subject for hours and still not be able to say everything that I have in my head. For that reason, let&#8217;s have a couple of examples of potentially destructive uses of public APIs, so you can see the big picture from the angle I see it. [...]</description>

		<description>I&#039;m probably very naive, but I just wish that browser implementors got rid of cookies in iframes. The only sensible use would be doubleclick and urchin anyway.</description>

		<description>[...] For the purpose of this exercise I employ a single technique that I discussed in detail over here. What this technique shows is that although parent documents cannot read the content of child iframes, child iframes can assign values to their parent&#8217;s fragment identifier. In conjunction with tinyurl storage capabilities and a simple trick, this technique can be used to make JavaScript agents live and bread on the web. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Although SOP works and it greatly improves the browser security, there are ways it can be circumvented to one degree or another. For example, I&#8217;ve demonstrated a simple technique where attackers can use publicly available anonymous proxies to unify the origins of two or more web resources. The techniques was used as a key component of Jikto, which was released by Billy Hoffman from SPI Dynamics as a Proof of Concept of how JavaScript can probe various websites for vulnerabilities and spread when XSS or SQL Injection holes are found.

		<description>There are some really cool attacks you can do with Ajax Bridges/proxies/gateways. Most of the time it makes more sense for an attacker to use the bridge on www.example.com to attack api.datastore.com than to directly attack api.datastore.com

Check out slides 37 - 45 (ignore the slanting)
