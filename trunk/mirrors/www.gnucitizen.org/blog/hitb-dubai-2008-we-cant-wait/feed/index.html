Cheers

		<description>Hey guys, just tell me when you will arrive. I am german, living and working in Dubai for a while. I will attend HiTB if my timesheet will agree. :)

If you are interested, I can show you the town, some fancy places to drink some b33r and talk about hacking so far.

Will rock.

Regards,
xai</description>

		<description>yeh, we will be careful, extremely careful for this trip as you don&#039;t want to end up in contradictions with the law. the basic idea is to go with as less things as possible, make yourself as unattractive as possible and make sure that you bring no drugs whatsoever, this includes cosmetics as well. buy them from there and throw them away before going back. it is also extremely important to have a very good reason for going there, which we have. I hope that they don&#039;t have laws for being a hacker, that you will hack something. :)</description>
