		<description>Exactly what I was looking for. I found an XSS at a different site , and needed a way to retrieve another page on the same site , parse it and extract sensitive data from it. (Yeah , I could steal the cookie and use it later, but I am doing a POC for the vendor, an so , need to make it more dramatic)
I aint no JS expert, so thanks for the code :-)</description>

		<description>Your spider example is broken. For some reason Proxydrop.com filters out all javascript. You should take another proxy.

		<description>[...] Solving obstacle one is hard. How can we know what input channels an application may posses? There might be some forms, but we don&#8217;t know about them. We can brute force names but that is slow and kind of lame. The simplest thing I come up with is to proxy the page through Google Translate and get the content by using the technique implemented in the JavaScript SPIDER proof of concept tool. Although it is slow and far from perfect, you must agree that it is a possible vector that can be employed. That&#8217;s not all. [...]</description>

Than John Resig, a developer with some cool AJAX projects on his belt claimed that this is not a problem at all, missunderstanding the subject. Than maluc, backed me up with this comment. Today I followed John&#8217;s blog and I found maluc&#8217;s personal respond on the matter. I really like the summary that he made, so I decided to put it on this site.

		<description>Wow .. such hatred. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Using a publicly-accessible anonymous proxy is hardly a security concern - especially considering that none of the user&#039;s personal information is passed along.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John, you apparently didn&#039;t understand the post at all. He&#039;s not claiming that those using proxies are at greater risk, or that their personal information can be disclosed by it. It has nothing to do with proxy users.

It&#039;s saying that by using certain public proxies you can work around the javascript&#039;s same origin policies. If you bothered reading his previous blog posts about Google Search API Worms, you&#039;d understand. Another tool in the arsenal, alongside google and yahoo&#039;s APIs

This may help you comprehend the security restrictions of javascript: http://www.windowsitlibrary.com/Content/1160/22/1.html

		<description>san, I admit that the code is quite bad but it was hacked in 30 minutes. What do you expect? What I am trying to do can be appreciated by those who understand the subject.

However, I think that the community will be quite interested in your solution if you manage to do what I am trying to do without using the technique I have already discussed. :)

I am not overconfident. Do I sound overconfident? I am sorry if this is the impression you are getting.</description>

		<description>wat  a stupid code , i dont think its useful in any way by gettin a anoymous proxy wat the heck u r tryin to do .. u seems a pretty overconfident starter in security. and everybody know anoymous proxy can be used to do lots of stuff lots of tool already there wat r u tryin to do</description>

		<description>Hi John, I appreciate your comment but from what I can see from your blog, you are not a dealing with security at all. That is the reason why I believe that you are more experienced in JavaScript programming than me and I am more experienced in security than you.

As far as what attack vector is... well, I am not claiming that my English is perfect but if we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define:vector&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; for the word vector you will see that there are mainly two types of definitions: one related to biology and one related to mathematics. Check these two samples:

&lt;blockquote&gt;carrier of an infectious agent; capable of transmitting infection from one host to another; especially the animal that transfers an infectious agent from one host to another, usually an arthropod. &lt;strong&gt;life.umd.edu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A vector is a number (a magnitude) together with a direction (compare with scalar). A vector can be represented by an arrow whose length represents the magnitude and the direction represents the direction. &lt;strong&gt;enchantedlearning.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is more than obvious what attack vector is.

You are also saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Honestly, the only thing that you &#039;discovered&#039; (and that was just something you noticed, as the world has passed you by) is that publicly-accessible anonymous proxies can be used for &quot;bad&quot; things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You are right for one thing. Publicly accessible proxies can be used for bad things and that&#039;s nothing new. However, who has done it in the past with JavaScript? I couldn&#039;t find anything like this on the web and to me it is a new thing.

John, I am very interested to see your opinion on this respond. Many thanks.</description>

		<description>[...] Eine ganze Menge JavaScript ist hingegen bei Gnucitizen&#8217;s JavaScript-Spider involviert. Mit diesem Tool ist es m?glich, v?llig anonym ?ber einen Proxy nach Wahl Seiten zu spidern. Wer sich also mal schnell einen Crawler zusammenbauen m?chte, um bei Google nach Foren bestimmten Typs oder ?hnlich unartigen Dingen zu suchen, hat nun die Gelegenheit, dies mit ein Paar Klicks zu tun. Mit solchen M?glichkeiten an der Hand bleibt es wahrscheinlich auch nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis die ersten Skripte &#8216;in the wild&#8217; sind, mit denen man ebenso anonym XSS und GET-Exploits automatisiert einschleusen kann.
