		<description>I have seen code like this in action, the result is pretty devastating. Anyway, I think the fault is not Google&#039;s. Website just should not have vulnerabilities. If you have a dark room with all your belongings in it, will you blame someone that hands you a flashlight?</description>

		<description>Problem: The results returned on each interation are the same results, no viral spread. The worm would have to integrate new keywords into it&#039;s search on each new target so as to get a fresh set of targets. While the point of it&#039;s search is looking for specifically exploitable paths/signatures. Additional keywords could be used to limit down results and get some fresh URLs but not easily.

JSON makes this a little easier but isn&#039;t something that was impossible before. Hitting pages and parsing results from HTML response is exactly the same as hitting some XML and parsing that, just a little more code.</description>

		<description>TruePath, you have some valid point here although I believe that this is just the beginning of the exploration. The more versatile AJAX technology become the more often it will be used for malicious activities.

P.S. you can use Google&#039;s own internal key. They use that key for all their examples. That one works everywhere on every domain.</description>

		<description>So I have to admit still being confused.  Are you advocating that client side scripting languages be denied *ANY* means of retrieving search data?  After all the way you stated your example it doesn&#039;t matter in the slightest how the JS gets the information so the only way to protect against this would be to deny ANY kind of google query from JS (or require user input or something).

I agree the ability to get search results makes JS worms slightly more dangerous but only slightly.  After all the author of the worm could merely release 50-100 worms into the wild each of them containing their own subset of compressed search queries (does search beforehand).  

Additionally I would thin the API key would prevent this sort of attack from going very far.  If you are trying to run this as a worm you will need a new API key for every domain you infect no?  (And if somehow you can use the same one won&#039;t google notice and shut you down?).  I suppose there is some chance you could try to grab the API key from the website you are attacking if it has one but that sounds mega-hard and less efficient than just preloading the data.

Moreover, if you have a server vulnerable to an SQL injection attack discoverable via google any number of baddies can attack it directly so the extra risk seems like not much to worry about.</description>

		<description>[...] The fact that there are numerous people concerned about the security of this API, is probably a good reason not to draw attention to the fact that it uses &#8220;On Demand&#8221; techniques. Under the current browser security model, I believe this is the only way you could write a javascript ONLY api that works cross domain. Personally, I am not that concerned about the security aspect of the API, but I think it is a mistake to use the improper AJAX, as opposed the more widely accepted Ajax. [...]</description>

		<description>A lot of Joomla sites were compromised by a series of attacks lately. Using GET/POST methods. It wasn&#039;t Joomla actually - it was several 3rd party components for the popular CMS. My point is...I do believe that a single attack can effect multiple sites...or let&#039;s say a single attack running over and over automated. Someone just unleashes it and it crawls the web like a search engine finding vulnerable sites... however to the point of chown, it has to be the SAME EXACTLY circumstance... To the point of pdp, that&#039;s not really all too uncommon - especially because of the one example I just made about the CMS.

All this means is developers need to be more careful. Generally speaking - the worm that would run SQL injection is probably easier to cut off at the head than other attacks...because a pattern can VERY easily be established and developers can fix the problem. Hopefully no one is using a compromised application for anything important such as payment transactions, etc. ...if there was a vulnerability with say a paypal site and someone was able to inject some SQL to change around where money is being sent... Well not hard to catch the person but WOW what a mess.

There is a big potential for disaster, but it&#039;s not a reason to not use Google&#039;s APIs. It&#039;s just you need to understand you are advertising your system to the world...which many people want to do anyway- we all want more web traffic...just not the malicious kind.

Of course google&#039;s code search also presents dangers too. Though I&#039;m sure that takes more of a manual labored approach for the script kiddies...where&#039;s the fun in that?</description>

		<description>[...] This is where pdp’s work with public services shows destructive potential. It’s still not a headless worm, but utilizing a server like google to search for vulnerable services .. http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-search-api-worms .. allows a worm of any size/load. Google has been used for years to do this - in PHP, Perl, asp, c++, java, flash, etc - but until recently it’s been thought impossible to use javascript for it. That gives XSS and SQL vulnerabilities a very dangerous weapon. The javascript spider expands this to other common services like proxies. [...]</description>

		<description>wasnewbie, persistency is definitely a big plus. However, worms that abuse Google AJAX Search API can use some sort of semi persistent method with dynamically generated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/backdooring-quicktime-movies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MOV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/backdooring-mp3-files&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/backdooring-flash-objects-receipt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SWF&lt;/a&gt; objects through the method I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/self-contained-xss-attacks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

For example the worm can generate dynamic SWF that mimics Google Video or YouTube video player. After the movie is previewed the user will be asked to share the object with others or blog it on their website. I know that it requires user interaction but let&#039;s me honest, people will happily do what they are asked for.</description>

		<description>Google AJAX Search API works with SCRIPT elements. This technique is also known as JavaScript on demand or JSON. Basically, a dynamic SCRIPT element is created that points to a remote URL which upon visit generates JavaScript that is evaluated inside the current browser. Since there are no restrictions on SCRIPT elements, this mechanism is quite suitable for implementing cross-domain functionalities.</description>

		<description>[...] I covered Google Search API functionalities a week ago. I also provided my view why this service is practically dangerous and how it can be used by AJAX/JavaScript based worms to propagate.
