		<description>Whenever I read about how QuickTime makes cyberspace more scary or dangerous (JS is JS; I have JS enabled in my browser, but I won&#039;t use IE outside the LAN; I just wish I could tell my browser to not load scripts from 3rd-party servers), it reminds me that the most dangerous thing about QuickTime movies is that the site with the most best hijacker-exculpatory 9/11 video evidence, 911blimp.net, chose to use QT (because, like a VCR, it lets the viewer pause and go frame-by-frame in either direction using the keyboard arrow keys) to present its videos.  So, to the extent that people can be made to be extra reluctant to even open a .mov file, that helps keep the evidence (and danger to the actual perpetrators) as well-suppressed as it&#039;s been.

BTW, that site (like this one) uses JS, harmlessly, but its QT videos do not contain any embedded code or scripts of any kind.</description>
