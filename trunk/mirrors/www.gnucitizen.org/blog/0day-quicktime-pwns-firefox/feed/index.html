		<description>What do I do now? One week ago, I got a Trojan, my Word documents were erratic, the Firewall antivirus detected nothing..MS were of no help beyond checking that my softwares were legal. I first got a paid Plus version of my AdAware, which promptly got erratic too, but detected and deleted a MRU. After I had tried to watch a YouTube [professional] video, I had noticed a QT icone come out of nowhere [my son installed iTunes on my laptop, which I never use - and Yes, I browse as an administrator, not knowing any better].  After AdAware, I also switched to Firefox, feeling fed-up with MS generally, and from checking on NoScript, I now got on your QT bug page - it tallies. WHAT DO I DO NOW? I guess this is of no interest to you [except as further proof on Windows users being morons!]but please direct me to people who can answer me: you are the only source of clear information I could get till now. Sorry to bother you, thank you for your activity - and thank you in advance if you can direct me. Francoise Mahenc</description>
