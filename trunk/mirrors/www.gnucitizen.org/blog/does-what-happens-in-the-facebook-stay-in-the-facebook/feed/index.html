		<description>this is interesting enough, but it doesn&#039;t adequately attend to it&#039;s own &#039;so what&#039; factor. I dont think the information is collected &#039;evily&#039; (is that even a word?). if the worst they can do with  my info is try and market new crap to the market, then i dont feel so threatened. i still shop and consume with my agency intact. unless the US military is going to beat down my door and attack my self and my family for not liking a particular film, or having daggy taste in music, or throwing a cyber sheep at someone i dont really care what they do with this data. capitalism is what it is: desperate and nasty. of-course these people will trawl through the internet like kids in india on a garbage pile looking for food. It&#039;s tragic, but I am not convinced from this bit of film that it is scary.</description>

		<description>The video is long on conspiracy implications and short on facts, but at least it gets interesting when they discuss Facebook&#039;s privacy policy.</description>
