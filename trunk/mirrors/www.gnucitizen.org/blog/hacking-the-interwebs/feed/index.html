		<description>More than two years have gone since this post and one from the last message... and I would like to know if the situation has evolved somehow. 

Is it still dangerous using UPnP? Did somebody try to make it more secure?

Thanks for your answer,</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t we just hack the router without UPnP. I mean just fire queries to change DNS settings using default admin/password when 90% of the people never care to change it?</description>

		<description>Fascinating! I&#039;m just a user of computers, neither and IT specialist nor a programmer but it seems that what you&#039;re saying is, once the hacker has obtained entry through to your network, the damage is done and turning uPnP off will be too late because the hackers are in. Is that right, or if I disable UPnP, will I be saved?

Excellent article though!

regards

		<description>Educational if esoteric discussion.  I&#039;m happy to say that my Netgear WGT624 does not enable UPnP by default, and I don&#039;t have a need to enable it as far as I can tell.</description>

		<description>Seer, thanks for the informative comment. I will have a look into the Adobe Flash Platform for the Digital Home which you&#039;ve mentioned. Since I&#039;ve been trying to hack my TV for some time now, this technology may prove to be very interesting.

I am not sure if I understand your last question correctly. I believe that you are suggesting that none one is implementing UPnP in real devices at the moment. This is not true. UPnP is virtually everywhere from embedded devices to mobile phones. As I mentioned before, my brand new TV has support for UPnP and pretty much every home router I&#039;ve seen is UPnP enabled.</description>

		<description>Hi there... About the &quot;discovery&quot; problem for hackers (how to guess UUIDs and ports ?), maybe Adobe &quot;solved&quot; it with its freshly announced &quot;Adobe Flash Platform for the Digital Home&quot; ? (I think not, as I develop further on)

I guess if it was available to anyone, this should provide developers APIs to read media (WebTVs) from real TVs/set-top boxes... why not from UPnP Media Servers ? Thus, things are getting easier, except if they restrain the supported requests to concern media stuff, and only it (no DNS change or port forwarding ?).

Anyway the special player may not be available to anyone except device manufacturers. With flash apps not gotten from the internet but deployed in the boxes (no download, only stream play ?), no problem. I guess then that we won&#039;t be able to play free flash games from the web ;) Or only certified ones ?

Keep in mind that all of it was just pure speculation and anticipation...

One last word : Good discussion indeed with lots of information. I haven&#039;t studied the UPnP Security profile, but would it provide solutions ? I believe (am I wrong ?) no manufacturer has implemented it yet :)</description>
