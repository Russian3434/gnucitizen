		<description>romain, actually what I was trying to refer to is the shift of tool building practices in the web application security field. IMO, most web app security tools vendors throw resources in the wrong direction.</description>

		<description>As you said, a tool is only for &quot;helping&quot;. There is no way we find a tool that does our work. But for sure some current tools are helping us (what would we all do without Tamper Data, Firebug...)</description>

		<description>let&#039;s not forget the most timeless web hacker tool: the browser :)

there are still serious web security issues like sql injection which can be found (and exploited) with just a browser. OK, some FF extensions help even more, especially if the vulnerable parameter doesnt get submitted in a URL which we can modify directly from the address bar.

at the end of the day there is nothing like Brain Technology (TM). granted, i agree web pentesting tools are very limited and we need better ones.</description>
