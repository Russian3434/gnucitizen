		<description>Jordan, thanks for the good research. yes, it is very interesting. Have you taken snapshots of the registry tree for each setup? because now we can detect what&#039;s the cause of it. I have some very wild guess but it is good to have some proof. cheers</description>

		<description>pdp -- I realize that, but there&#039;s something else going on.  Check this out to see what I mean:

XPSP2 with no patches + Firefox = Exploit fails
XPSP2 with all patches (sans IE7) + Firefox = Exploit fails
XPSP2 with all patches (including IE7) + Firefox = Exploit succeeds!
XPSP2 with no patches + Firefox + Thunderbird installed and configured = Exploit fails
XPSP2 with no patches except for IE7 + Firefox + Thunderbird = Exploit succeeds!

I&#039;ve tried other combinations besides those, and the only way I can get the exploit to succeed is if IE7 is installed.  If anyone&#039;s able to get the exploit working without IE7 installed, I&#039;d be really curious to know.</description>

		<description>Jordan, again, it depends on the URL handler for the &lt;strong&gt;mailto:&lt;/strong&gt; protocol.

Adrian, yes, yes and yes.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s very worrying how easy it is to exploit this vulnerability and how well it works.

I must research these URI handler bugs!</description>

		<description>Ok, just ran it a second time after reverting the snapshot, and sure enough -- a base SP2 machine is /not/ vulnerable for some reason.  Got the regmon logs, but I don&#039;t have the time to parse through them right now.  

Here&#039;s a zip with a screenshot showing the exploit fail, regmon logs of the exploit both failing and then succeeding on the same machine just with and without patches:

Maybe someone else can figure it out while I get back to pretending to work on this other project here at my office.  ;-)</description>

		<description>pdp -- there&#039;s something else involved in the process that&#039;s disrupting it.

I just grabbed all the updates for the SP2 machine, and /now/ the exploit works.  Outlook Express is still registered as the mailto handler just like it was before I grabbed the updates.  

So in short, install a standard SP2 machine.  Exploit fails.  Install latest security patches.  Exploit succeeds.  

Lemme verify it again and use regmon to trace the registry calls to see if I can find out what&#039;s different.</description>

		<description>Jordan, the vector does not work if you have Outlook as a default &lt;strong&gt;mailto:&lt;/strong&gt; handler. If your default Mail client is Thunderbird, then you shouldn&#039;t have any problem with launching the attack. BTW, try using other protocols. It works like a charm.</description>

		<description>Odd -- I&#039;ve been trying to test this in a base XP image, with no luck.  Does it really require SP2 to work?  That&#039;d be kind of ironic.  Outlook Express is the default registered mail handler for mailto: on the test system I just installed into vmware.  I&#039;m going through the upgrades now, testing it at each step to see at what point it becomes vulnerable.</description>
