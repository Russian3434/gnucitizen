		<description>XSS Shell is nice (I also wrote about this program at my site), as Backweb, XSS Proxy and BEEF are.

And about the name for your project, pdp ;-).

Backweb is pretty name, but in case that you need new name, I can advise you to take BACKEND Attack Console (BACKEND) from those you said.

Also BACKFRAME is nice. As you already selected this name (I saw your article &quot;Backframe 2.x Sneak Preview&quot;). First time I thought that it is another your project, but later I read that you had to change project&#039;s name. So I also need to write at my site about new name of your project :-) (ex-Backweb).</description>
