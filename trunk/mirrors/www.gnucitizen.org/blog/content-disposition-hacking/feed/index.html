		<description>@eXeCuTe - IE 7 displays a warning when opening files locall - which is great in my opinion. Even opening a .html file with a empty JS snippet causes the warning to show: 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;script&gt;//TEST&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

On Firefox however, no warning is shown, which scares me as you can steal any files by using XHR()

Anyway, if you can cause manipulate the content-disposition reponse on a site, you can exploit the trust the victim has on that brand/company.

@Alice and @eXeCuTe - what you guys are telling is creeping the heck out of me! I guess we all are in similar frequencies!</description>

		<description>Alice, it&#039;s even more weird. i also tried that, yesterday, and now i see this.. strange :)

anyway, this is a really cool idea... but i do get the ActiveX warning on IE, even if i don&#039;t use any off-site files, why is that?
with FF it works great..</description>

Very good work- it&#039;ll come in handy.</description>

		<description>This is a lot similar to many forum services that offer user-uploadable attachments, and then use the &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; header to have them appear in a prompt as displayed. I&#039;ve never come across a situation other than something along those lines though I did do some experimenting with files served in that manner, and figured that as the file executes in a local zone (the internet cache) if one could convince someone else to open the file as long as it did not contain any off-site files it should render on Internet Explorer without the ActiveX warning appearing.</description>
