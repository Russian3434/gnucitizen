		<description>Kudos for flagging an important security issue.  Detailed scrutiny of specifications and implementations that change the browser sandboxing model is desirable, welcome and absolutely necessary.  

That said, the article appears to spout FUD more than any credible security vulnerability in either the specification or Mozilla&#039;s implementation.  

The same-origin policy on the web is not the end-all-be-all-solution for proper sandboxing.  The same-origin policy greatly limits the type of applications that can be built.

Kudos to Firefox for implementing this.  Properly secured, this capability will open the flood gates to an entirely new wave of interoperability and application richness on the web.</description>

		<description>Great article.. but the headline is a bit misleading.
It implies that Firefox is the problem.... not the spec.</description>

		<description>pdp writes &quot;I am not completely sure whether your specifications will result in more accurate port scanning with JavaScript. [...] As far as I am concerned it is your job to make sure that this doesnâ€™t happen.&quot;

Yes. Yes it is.

P.S. you can play with the proposed Firefox 3 implementation of this feature _today_ by downloading a nightly build. The $500 Mozilla Security Bug Bounty applies if you can demonstrate an actual data-stealing same-origin violation in it, no need to wait for the actual release. We&#039;d much prefer to know now, in fact.</description>

		<description>I would suggest you carefully study the specification. Specifically the algorithm for the send() method. You will notice that method protection is in place, that port scanning as well as finding out whether there&#039;s some intranet to attack is protected, et cetera. If you do not carefully study the specification nor the implementation and just make bold claims you will indeed turn out to be wrong.</description>

		<description>Anne and Thomas Roessler,

First of all the comments are always open. Everyone can comment! Second, I am not sure if I am mistaken or you guys are fighting for the wrong cause. I am going to quietly wait until u guys come with Firefox3 and then we all will see whether your specification is inherently insecure or not. I hope &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;.

To repeat, IMHO u have some quite obvious security gaps. I am referring to the specifications outlined &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here (XMLHttpRequest level 2, Editor&#039;s draft 9 August 2007)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here (Enabling Read Access for Web Resources)&lt;/a&gt;.

Let&#039;s have a brief overview of your mistakes, the way I see them:

&lt;h3&gt;First of all&lt;/h3&gt;

You perform the access control checks after the request was completed. This is insane! You are saying that CSRF attacks are known for ages and you are not really contributing to the greater evilness of the Web. I must disagree. CSRF attacks via Forms (POST and GET) or Images (GET) and Links (GET) cannot contain additional headers. They do not have fine-grain over the data that is submitted. Therefore, your method makes the whole situation more &lt;strong&gt;insecure&lt;/strong&gt;. I highly recommend to read Wade&#039;s excellent paper on &lt;q&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/papers/InterProtocolExploitation.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Inter-Protocol Exploitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/q&gt; for more ideas how your approach can be abused.

&lt;h3&gt;Second&lt;/h3&gt;

None of the cpecs explicitly specify what methods should be used with your access control system. I am sure that you are both great coders and have a lot of good stuff to offer when it comes to specifications and design, but I am breaking into WebApp applications all day long. I&#039;ve probably seen stuff that you guys cannot even imagine. The world is not perfect. I highly recommend to consider implementing a METHOD restriction, such as only GET and POST have the ability to perform cross-domain operations.

&lt;h3&gt;Third&lt;/h3&gt;

The whole idea of cross-domain communication is just plain &lt;strong&gt;insecure&lt;/strong&gt;.  I am not saying that Adobe&#039;s crossdomain.xml implementation is any better. I am just implying that we are going to have a lot more problems then now - all of them trust related. Good that only Firefox is going to implement these specs so Internet is not going down, yet.

&lt;h3&gt;Finally&lt;/h3&gt;

I am not completely sure whether your specifications will result in more accurate port scanning with JavaScript. Maybe I am just day dreaming. But I don&#039;t care. As far as I am concerned it is your job to make sure that this doesn&#039;t happen.

Before you flame me back, please take my points as just pure critic on the specifications, nothing personal. We are all grownups here, no matter who is mistaken we shouldn&#039;t really convert the entire matter into a war. I&#039;ve made tones of mistakes in my life and I hope that I make even more in the future. There is no better way to learn new things. Making mistakes is not a really a problem. The problem is not being able to react properly when they happen.

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Please, if I am missing an important paragraph in both drafts, which clearly solves the problems I mentioned earlier, do post it here. I will happily withdraw my statements with a follow-up comment and apologize for the caused troubles.&lt;/div&gt;

Otherwise, if we all agree that there might be some problems, even if they are minor for now, let&#039;s sit down and work them out. Let&#039;s not leave pride and other elements prevent us making the world slightly better place.

P.S. so far my research has caused only trouble :) however, don&#039;t shoot the messenger!</description>

		<description>If you do not read the specification carefully no wonder you can dream up all kinds of security holes. The specification makes very precise requirements on non same-origin requests. See also http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2007Aug/0034.html for some comments on this post from a Firefox implementor.</description>

		<description>Anne,

I don&#039;t have much time to read the spec again but by skimming through it very quickly, I stumbled across the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conforming user agent must support some version of the HTTP protocol. It should support any HTTP method that matches the Method production and must at least support the following methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HEAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So u guys are not explicitly preventing TRACE, which potentially, again I repeat, potentially can lead to some problems.

Moreover, logically, ready state 3 should fire no matter the security restrictions. Am I wrong?</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not sure how you think your attacks will work given the algorithms outlined in http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html although given that the specification is not entirely done yet there may be some issues I suppose. (Disclaimer: I&#039;m the editor of both XMLHttpRequest level 2 and the Enabling Read Access for Web Resources specification.)</description>

		<description>Yeah. I agree with your writeup. I think the only secure way to do it is to bring digital signatures into play. Any kind of list (Content-Access-Control, allowed javascript, what ever else needs to be locked down) that provides restrictions has to be protected from modification. They need to include a digital signature to assure the browser that the security settings are exactly what the server set and nothing has modified it.</description>

		<description>Dan, absolutely. Keep in mind that what I&#039;ve put here is yet to be verified. All I am saying is the following:

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The industry requires a way for performing cross-domain XHR without the need of a proxy. The standards that will come to solve this problem will cause &lt;strong&gt;probably&lt;/strong&gt; more problems then what we have today.&lt;/div&gt;

Ronald said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;they are violating the same origin policy&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is right. Ignore the all specifications problems that we&#039;ve discussed so far. We don&#039;t know whether they are going to by present in Firefox&#039;s implementation. Let&#039;s concentrate on the fact that attackers will be able to obtain sensitive information from multiple sites by compromising only one of them. The trust relationship that will be built on top of the web will be used in the most undesired ways.

Let&#039;s say that Yahoo wants to enable all of their service to communicate with each other but only for their domains. This is cool - sort of secure. However, if the attacker manages to get only one XSS on any of the trusted domains, they effectively can get interesting info from all the others. To me, this is like back in 1990 - everything is broken again.</description>

		<description>Like Jesse I&#039;m having trouble mapping the internetnews.com article onto reality. I&#039;ll stick with a discussion of cross-site XHR.

I&#039;m not sure where TRACE is coming from. Earlier versions of the XMLHttpRequest spec explicitly disallowed it, and that&#039;s certainly true of the Firefox implementation. Regardless of spec I can&#039;t see Firefox re-enabling support for TRACE in XHR.

Firefox 3 nightlies already implement cross-site XHR support, I encourage you to play with it and poke holes based on reality rather than mangled press reports.

If a web server has a CRLF injection problem then that&#039;s a problem regardless of this new feature. It could, for instance, lead to an XSS problem which allows equivalent data exfiltration to what you worry about here.

Your port-scanning example is a great one, I&#039;ll find out who to bug to get the spec changed to skip or delay state 3 for cross-domain requests. Thanks!

If the FF XML engine is vulnerable to a buffer overflow then you exploit FF directly by loading an XML page or frame. XHR doesn&#039;t change a thing.

I&#039;m disappointed not seeing anything in the spec about preventing the reading of cookies or other sensitive headers in cross-site requests. That needs to be made explicit.</description>

		<description>goddamgeek, thanks for spotting this one. it should be ASCII 13 (\r) and ASCII 10 (\n) or simply %0D%0A, as you said.

Brian, we can add a lot of preventing mechanisms on the client but they all seams to be hacks and look a bit ugly and not on place. CRLF is a valid character sequence and if developers wants to use it for whatever reason, they should be able to. As for the extension, yes you can. Check Tamper Data source code.</description>

		<description>PDP - Would it be possible to create a Firefox extension that automatically inserts a &quot;Content-Access-Control: allow &quot; header into every response before the response is received by the XHR object?</description>

		<description>Very interesting article, PDP.  The CRLF injection and TRACE/TRACK method attacks seem like they could probably be easily prevented.  Couldn&#039;t Firefox 3 be designed not to send CRLF characters and TRACE/TRACK requests off-domain with the XHR object?  

But it seems strange that the browser actually has to make a cross-domain request and receive a response in order to determine whether or not it is allowed to look at the response.  That&#039;s just asking for trouble.</description>
