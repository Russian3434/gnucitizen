		<description>I recently attended a training seminar on business decision making and one of the most interesting things the speaker pointed out was that the best solution to a problem is to recast the situation so that the problem is no longer a problem.  This is classic &quot;out of the box&quot; thinking.  It&#039;s interesting to see network security evolve a paradigm shift that treats the network as hostile (even the internal network).  It is this kind of shift that allows you to remove many traditional &quot;problems&quot; of security by assuming they&#039;re actually the norm rather than anomalous.  I think the crux of this approach is to recognize that most servers provide open services to the internet.  When an attacker attempts a brute force of a service it&#039;s not actually an attack, or even an exploitation of the service, the attacker is utilizing the service *exactly* as it was intended.  While the behavior may be the harbinger of &quot;very bad&quot; things to come, the system itself is operating according to design.  In order to remove the attacker&#039;s brute force attack you have to fundamentally change the design of the public service, or accept the attack as part of the normal state affairs.</description>
