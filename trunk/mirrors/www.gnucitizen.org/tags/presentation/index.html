<p>It is pointless to explain how the attack works. Go over the presentation slides or get the video/audio. What I would like to do is to present some of my thoughts regarding the attack and its impact. [...]</p>

<p>Now there were a few funny things but the most funnies of all was that I&#8217;ve got flagged by Seba for having a sales pitch within my slides. Actually, my intentions were totally different. Moreover, it is silly to sell very niche services to wide-range of Web app guys. [...]</p>
