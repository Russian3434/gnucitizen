<p>The testing engine used in this particular version of Websecurify is optimized to run with the least possible amount of memory.

The story goes that NoScript used some JavaScript tactics and, of course, some obfuscations in order to cripple the Adblock Plus functionalities. This attack was a response to Adblock Plus blocking NoScript ads which you see when you upgrade the extension, which as you know happens quite regularly, don&#8217;t know why. [...]</p>
