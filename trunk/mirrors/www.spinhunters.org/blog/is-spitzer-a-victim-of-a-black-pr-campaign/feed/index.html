		<description>Interesting post. I have to admit that this is well outside of my realm of knowledge, but it interests me so I started reading.

I have to say when I first saw this news it didn&#039;t sit right with me, like it was too convenient though I didn&#039;t really know why. The way the information was leaked, how it doesn&#039;t match normal trends for this type of activity, and his past actions all point to this being a smear as you pointed out, and as for me, I&#039;d put my money on either the Republicans, some big fish, or creating a distraction for the reasons behind this one. Seeking fame has a good possibility too, though I haven&#039;t seen the singer milking too much publicity out of this yet, so unless I just missed seeing it I don&#039;t think its one of the reasons for this smear. Guess we&#039;ll all have to pay close attention to all the visible aftermath and watch for other attacks to figure this whole thing out.</description>
