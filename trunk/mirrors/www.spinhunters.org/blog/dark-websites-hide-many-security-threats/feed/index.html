		<description>Clearly their physical security is appalling - if you&#039;re letting hackers into your intranet, their posting of your &quot;dark website&quot; is the least of your worries. Lets see a shareholder reaction when client information is leaked - a much worse PR scenario.</description>

I agree that there are many types of scenario, although, I have outlined the one which I believe is the most critical from public relations point of view. FYI, this type of scenario have already happened in Greece two years ago, where one of the major Pharmaceutical corporations was affected.</description>

		<description>&quot;All the black-hats need to do is gain access to the internal corporate network, scan the saved HTML files and launch the domain, pretending that this comes from someone inside the company.&quot;

You&#039;re kidding right? Reach further into the pit of &quot;never going to happen&quot; please. It&#039;s easier to just DoS the site off the net, providing the exact same effect (which will make less than 0% difference to any company&#039;s stock prices, just FYI), except that, guess what - consumers aren&#039;t &quot;confused&quot; when a site goes down, they just shrug it off and move to another source of information. If the break is prolonged, and the target is a large, frequently used site, then the reaction is a little different, but good luck &quot;accessing the internal network and running domains&quot; of Google or Wikipedia. L o l.</description>
