		<description>Yes, i agree that there is a lot of scope for such a service today.

Most companies are aware of conventional vulnerabilities in many areas of their business, yet are unable to perceive the multitude of different ways that they could be targeted via a Black PR attack. Look at the corporate risk register and it has most definately matured over the years, but you will not find risk mitigation strategies for the most sophisticated black hat attacks. As markets are thrown up in the air with the credit crisis, the nature of competitive edge will change and executives will not only have to think more intensely about the forward momentum of performance, but be a lot more aware of watching their backs from ever-more sophisticated black hat attacks.

I have found that the most difficult thing for executives is to admit to being open to such attacks. There has also been a reluctance by security providers to fund research in this area.</description>
