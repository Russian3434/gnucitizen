		<description>Hi, Trolling is an exercise in un&quot;troll&quot;able, unrestrained rage. Rage is the most difficult emotion to control on the Internet. Both for the carrier and the target.

I believe trolling to be one of the most dangerous threats to maintaining the integrity of Internet, since its inception.

Trolls are some of the smartest people online, but they are infected by toxic rage. Rage gives them a competitive edge in combat. Understanding how to manage angry people, is the best way of identifying their presence and of dealing with their many subversive ways.
