		<description>@Antrix - yes, you&#039;re right: the VPN-1 Edge vuln is old. That&#039;s why I said &quot;Early versions of Checkpoint VPN-1 Edge&quot;. 

I just mentioned VPN-1 Edge vuln as a real example. This post is NOT an advisory of a new vulenrability, but rather an explanation of IP address-based session management vulnerabilities.

Thanks for your feedback everyone!</description>

		<description>@C4 - you&#039;re right. This type of attack could be launched against a basic router as well. Any embedded device could be affected by this vulnerability. Of course, provided that its administrative web interface solely trusts the admin&#039;s source IP for authentication purposes.

I wrote this post with any type of embedded devices in mind. i.e.: cameras, printers, VoIP phones, firewalls, routers, switches, etc ...</description>

		<description>This could be used on any basic router as well, as long as the you can do it before the admin session TTL times out?</description>

		<description>OK, trusting source IP addresses for authentication purposes on embedded devices is pretty bad, but doing the same thing on credit card transaction environments is just insane!</description>
