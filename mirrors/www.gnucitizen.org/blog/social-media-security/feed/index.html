		<description>One desirable approach to allay your fears is to prepare a retirement plan that structures your money to safeguard your principal with investment risks you can afford, establishes an emergency fund if you have enough, minimizes your tax burden, and provides a lifetime income plan you can&#039;t outlive.</description>
