		<description>Hi,

I am still curious if the launch of Chrome was something &quot;unintentional&quot;. I wrote a little piece of article about this, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitstopmedia.com/sem/googles-chrome-coincidence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&#039;s Chrome, a coincidence?&lt;/a&gt;. I also kept a log on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitstopmedia.com/sem/google-chrome&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;how Chrome evolved from search engines point of view&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks,
TraiaN</description>

		<description>I think the launch of Google Chrome is going to sink firefox in the long run, and it makes it much more painful for web developers because another browser means another platform they&#039;ll have to test their websites on. But I actually like Chrome, it&#039;s very robust.</description>

		<description>If anyone cannot scroll up, I released a program to quickly and automatically fix the &quot;cannot scroll up using certain touch pads&quot; issue for Google Chrome (until Chrome is fixed officially). Just run chrome_patch.exe. It will modify chrome.dll to fix the issue. You can download/read about it at http://digg.com/software/Google_Chrome_68</description>

		<description>A few more words on the speed :we&#039;ve measured the speed of our aplication (http://www.taskwriter.com) on Google Chrome, and it&#039;s just a bit faster than Firefox 3.0 . IE is well behind. The graphs are here : http://www.taskwriter.com/blog/how-good-chrome-really-is</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t believe how quiet all the browser bug hunters are at the moment. I was positive Ronald would have put something together for us by now or Rsnake would have found a post in something bad about the whole Google influence... but nothing. I guess its just a matter of time before ppl get through with analyzing the source code and bam, we will have a flood of 0days.

Anyways atm, the 1 common theme I&#039;m seeing from the bugs coming out is that there doesn&#039;t seem to be enough data validation (i.e.checking string lengths etc) in its routine processing which seems to be cause for most issues. 

Finally, I plan to document all the bugs/spoilts for Chrome as they come out and you can keep up to date on them here - http://chromekb.com/vulnerabilities/</description>

		<description>The new Google Chrome browser is very nice and is surprising really fast. I can&#039;t wait to see the final addition of this browser maybe a darker skin and some new add ons and perhaps a spell check. If so I will be using this browser alot. Keep it up Google!</description>

		<description>Yes Chrome does sound pretty good, however I&#039;d recommend checking out this blog post as well as it points out some of the defects (granted it is beta but some of their points are valid imo)

Also make sure to pay attention to the snippet of the EULA statement quoted in the post.</description>

		<description>Google Chrome has 2 very very important security holes. Which can let some bad webmasters upload exe files to your computers without your prompt !! Go ahead and continue loving Google Chrome. When your computer suddenly shuts down and when you realize all your data is gone dont blame anybody but Google Chrome..
