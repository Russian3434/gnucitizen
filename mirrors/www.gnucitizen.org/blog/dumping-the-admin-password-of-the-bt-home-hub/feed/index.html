		<description>This is security through obscurity at it&#039;s finest.  Gotta love the lottery comment - perhaps if each attempt was the equivalent to purchasing a ticket, but since there&#039;s zero cost to attempt it&#039;s not exactly a robust analogy.</description>

		<description>Hi guys, I decided to stop using bthh. So I bought a drytek 2820n router. I was trying to get it to work but failed. At some stage of router installation it asks me for a username and password for WAN1, which, it says, I should had been given by my ISP - BT. Now, I don&#039;t know where to get this details from? Any advice most appreciated.</description>

		<description>I can still confirm that bt homehubs are very insecure. I went to the router page and noticed that it shows you everyone who has logged on to your network going by computer name and mac address. My computer name kind of gives me away, so i looked at this for getting the admin password.

I can confirm the python scripts do work on windows using the method john smith said, but also confirm Robbies method works as well, and is a lot easier to do. You now have to go here to download the scripts: http://lab.gnucitizen.org/projects/bt-home-hub-s-n-dumper

the software version is now 6.2.6H and even though i got the unique ID, I cant log on using it (with CP in front) someone said it prompts you to change it straight away now? I think im stuck or is there anything i can do to get it now?</description>

		<description>It worked on python for windows for me. The standard 2.6 installer. I just ran the dump script by double-clicking. Then ran the fetch script by double-clicking. It took a couple of tries for the fetch but worked in the end. Of course, that password is only the admin password until the owner visits the hub&#039;s homepage, whereupon they are required to set a new one immediately.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m attempting to run this on backtrack 3. I&#039;ve run the scripts as you have said yet I get no feedback in Konsole.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bt ~# cd /tmp
bt tmp # python mdap-dump.py &amp;
[1] 6763
bt tmp # python mdap-send-ant-search.py
ANT-SEARCH MDAP/1.1
46
bt tmp #&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

That is all I get. I&#039;m connect as follows: Windows XP machine (192.168.1.164) &gt; VMWare Bridge &gt; backtrack 3 (192.168.1.78). Does this mean the network is secure?</description>

		<description>@joe: the Python scripts we provided only seem to work in Linux (we tested them on backtrack 2 but should also work on bt3).

If you just want to get the Hub&#039;s serial number prior to authenticating without using the MDAP protocol, then simply check &#039;OU&#039; field of the SSL certificate as mentioned by Aaron on http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/dumping-the-admin-password-of-the-bt-home-hub-pt-2/

You should be able to examine the Hub&#039;s SSL certificate by accessing: https://api.home/ or https://192.168.1.254</description>

		<description>After having observed BT&#039;s reaction to several Home Hub vulnerabilities published in the past, it&#039;s easy to notice BT&#039;s PR template. It kind of goes like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;We do not believe any of our customers have been affected by this attack.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Such security research describes a theoretical attack.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reality this translates to: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are not aware of any attack performed in a _mass fashion_ which uses such vulnerabilities. Of course this doesn&#039;t mean such vulnerabilities have not been exploited in the wild. We know that most likely they *have* been exploited as they are practical. However, we don&#039;t want mainstream users (i.e: non-technical) to know this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;We want the public to think that such attack is not possible in real life, so they do not realize how bad the current state of the security of the Home Hub really is.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
