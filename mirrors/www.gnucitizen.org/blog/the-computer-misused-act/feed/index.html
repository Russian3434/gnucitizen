		<description>I read this a few days ago and am terribly disturbed. It&#039;s just one more demonstration of the severely flawed logic used in the decision making process of (most) lawmakers and enforcers in countries today. The world of the technologist has progressed so far beyond that of the bureaucrat, and these laws heavily magnify the failings of their top-down ideology. Top-down fixes never work, the U.S education system is a blindingly obvious example, and it is akin to putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. Yet politicians are able to defend shortcomings through obscurity of the law, societal and departmental issues. In the face of technology, namely the internet, there are no societal and departmental boundaries to hide behind, which puts the crudeness of their â€œfixâ€ strategy in the spotlight.  

I&#039;m beginning to wonder if govt organizations just need fresh blood? As a developer, researcher, scientist, think of all the problems where youâ€™ve worked hard to derive an optimal solution?  Why arenâ€™t we seeing this in govt?  Am I just going off the deep end with this?  My point is, I see more failure than progress, in comparison to a booming tech corporate sector. How can we get more critical thinkers, problem solvers, and people who understand technology into the places that matter?  

Egads - Maybe itâ€™s not as bad as it seems.  This just really ruffled my feathers.</description>

		<description>Pdp,

--
ok.. the PDF case whent out of control as you said... i know! POCs come out and more...
--
   
But please.. canÂ´t you agree with me something?

The &quot;Adobe developers&quot; and  &quot;Adobe PDF users&quot; where not alerted about the security hole in time?
This is not better than when you donÂ´t have any idea of a security hole and someone is using it?

Please dude.. as you see my english is a %#$#%! I hope that you are understanding what i type.</description>

		<description>I just want to say that i believe that all of us here were expecting something like this new laws. All the time we see that many authors of digital crimes are not going to be arrested because there are no &quot;specifics laws&quot; for this kind of &quot;cyber crimes&quot;.
And the government&#039;s are starting to create this mechanisms  to prevent and punish people that take the bad way. But of course, as many others times they are making mistakes. They think that creating this new rules they will stop the thing &quot; at startup&quot; when you are just studying or learning about hacking, but as all you said &quot;this will not happend&quot;.

Pdp compared the situations to the media piracy scenarios, and what we have today? Yes... i am asking it to you.

We have things like Emule, torrent and others... people using p2p networks to have acess to piracy media, software, ebooks, serials and other things.
Is just a question of time until the exploits and hackin material databases go to the same way.

But, i agree with Tronyx the &quot;good guys&quot; will be considered &quot;bad guys&quot; and all the comunits as gnucitizen are going to be considered &quot;bad guys&quot;.
Is that realy? Is that true? I don&#039;t think it so. And believe that you dont.. i really hope so.

All this kind comunitÂ´s do is act like white hatÂ´s  do. They study ways to find securiy holes and spread it to the web comunity.. respecting the companyÂ´s that have securty problems and giving time to they correct the bug until this go to web.

Do you remember the PDF case last year? 

To sum up, i just want to say that &quot; they need it&quot; ... &quot;they need us&quot;  .... and they need &quot; ETHICAL HACKING &quot;.
 Many companys that develop software donÂ´t have time or professionals to develop something that really have security inside. Thats why i believe that they really need us.

Can you see a word where security professionals are no able search or publish information about secuty holes? Becouse ... i dont!</description>

		<description>The interesting thing about this law it how shortsighted it is.  Its only real interest appears to be a way to stop those that are interested in being publicly legitimate.

The &#039;bad&#039; hackers already break plenty of laws, what&#039;s one more?  This law only affects those that care about the law to begin with.

As these laws progress and get increasingly absurd, the more people will flagrantly ignore them (at least I suspect they will).  Look at software and music piracy.  There&#039;s a good helping of laws against those things, but they don&#039;t appear to be dying down now do they?</description>

		<description>The amendment is indeed a scary prospect. We did a podcast discussing this issue at length and the potential problems, most of which are conjecture at the moment, but it leaves you with a scary sense of the unknown. You can grab the podcast at http://media.libsyn.com/media/sploitcast/sploitcast_25.mp3

I love the way you link this with the concept of security through obscurity. I never looked at it so directly as that before but I think you make a good concise point. (Conciseness being rather lacking in the podcast hehe).</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t let those Brits and Germans take our top place for, silly, goofy, and just plain wrong laws.

We&#039;ll most likely get a similar law here, probably written worse too, and chances are it will happen like this. Clueless House member listens to clueless lobbyist who heard this Act will cut down on &quot;evil&quot; hacking, they then go on to spread the word to everyone they know and all of those people are clueless too, so when voting time comes we&#039;ve got a lot of clueless people approving something they think is good even though it&#039;s likely going to be worse than the Computer Misuse Act.

We get a new law then, and likely AnDrEw above me is right, so we wind up with the &quot;War on Hackers&quot; based on this new law.

Security researchers find themselves either in a new line of work or meeting &quot;Bubba&quot; in the cell block, hackers go underground, and the police units to deal with cybercrime ultimately fail miserably since all the security researchers that could&#039;ve trained them are missing for some reason. Heck, it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if our law is written so bad that a security researcher who sticks around and trains the cybercrime units winds up arrested after teaching one due to some miswritten clause in it.</description>

		<description>It is an awfully familiar concept, and makes sense, pdp. I&#039;m sure you are correct when you say the United States will be following suit. Seems like just another &quot;war&quot;, which will undoubtedly cause the exact opposite of what it was started for (War on Drugs, War on &quot;Terror&quot;, et cetera).</description>
