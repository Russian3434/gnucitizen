		<description>The solution to this dilemma seems obvious.  Instead of paying security researchers per bug found, pay them by the hour, or put them on salary.  Pay full time security researchers around $75K a year (depending on skill and time worked), pay for their health care, a 401K, and/or other customary benefits in their country, instead of paying them per bug.  Then the bugs get released when they are found, and shared with all other security researchers, and researchers get paid for their work.  

This system is preferable for most people to getting paid a lot per bug because if offers long term financial security for the researcher.  Most people wouldn&#039;t risk a decent job for quick cash, and since selling bugs to shady 3rd parties would get them fired, as well as the other the potential consequences you mentioned, they&#039;d have a big incentive not to do it.

They could pay non-professionals something for submitting bugs, but the biggest incentive for a non-salary researcher to submit bugs would be to prove they&#039;re worth hiring.

This is the system most academic disciplines use and works for most of them.</description>

		<description>Jeremy,

As I mentioned in the blog post, I would love to see security researcher getting paid more but not by the means of extortion. This approach will not only backfire soon but also it will undermine all of our hard work. I don&#039;t mind if you can get paid 75K for a bug. If you can and you are happy with the terms of the deal than you should do it. What I do mind is the whole &lt;q&gt;no more free bugs&lt;/q&gt; campaigning.

What the &lt;q&gt;no more free bugs&lt;/q&gt; campaign promotes is not to disclose critical information unless certain demands are met. It sounds ridiculous and terribly wrong!

Also, it is pretty subjective to talk about how much Apple and other software and hardware vendors are willing to pay for a bug. Keep in mind that if they know that a vulnerability in their products worths $75K they would have had a proper bounty program. As far as I know, Mozilla is one of the few vendors which offer bounties for bugs and they are not paying that much, i.e. you are not going to get rich.

As a matter of fact, I hear that ZDI has bought some vulnerabilities for at least $50K in some instances. I am not sure if this is true but if it is than I guess the market is finding its own way to justify the cost. However, if bugs can be sold to vendors for $50K than why should anyone bother with pwn2own competitions where you are making a lot less then that?</description>

		<description>&quot;Dino, from purely business perspective, $75K is an impossible sum to get out of a vendor or a vulnerability disclosure program. For that amount of money any company can outsource a whole team of researchers specializing finding vulnerabilities in a single product.&quot;

Excuse me but when a vulnerability is worth $75k on the vuln-black market we&#039;re talking about vendors with massive market penetration.  We&#039;re talking Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, IBM, etc.

From a purely business perspective, WTF is 75k to these companies?  Let&#039;s pretend for a moment that Adobe could pay for that whole 0day issue to jut go away... do you think they would pay a 75k for that to never have happened?  What was the impact on Adobe&#039;s image? their brand? The issue here is the same one that plagues the entire security industry - what metrics do we use to quantify the damage?

If 75k was all it took to hire &#039;an entire team&#039; of security researches to hammer away at a complex product (and it&#039;s not) then companies shouldn&#039;t damn well be doing it?  If they&#039;re not... they should pay dearly.

If I go out and buy a lawn mower and it has bugs... i can return it and get my money back... or at least get a new one without the bugs.  If the bug in the lawnmower cuts off my foot (INSERT CONFICKER DAMAGE ESTIMATE HERE!) I&#039;m effing pissed and I sue Lawnmower Co.  If I go buy a Quicktime media broadcasting product and my .com gets pwned and I spend $??k fixing the internal breach can I sue? No.  

(Unfortunately) I agree that companies won&#039;t pay $75k for a game-over vulnerability in their product but that&#039;s because they aren&#039;t measuring the impact that their bad code has on their image and, more importantly, they aren&#039;t held accountable for the damage they cause around the globe when their shitty code breaks.</description>

		<description>oh you mean where you said &quot;Now, coding exploits has nothing to do with finding bugsâ€¦ seriouslyâ€¦ especially when all you want to achieve is a crash which can be replicated.&quot;

Why would you only want to achieve a crash? It goes without saying that is only half of the exercise. No one&#039;s going to pay for code that only causes a fault, they want the exploit that goes along with it.

Also the level of difficulty of coding exploits vs. finding bugs is subjective, I would not be surprised one bit to find those same sweatshops workers not only running fuzzers but also coding the sploits to go along with them... this isn&#039;t exactly quantum calculations, this is bottom feeding leg work.</description>

		<description>g/, the whole &lt;q&gt;no more free bugs&lt;/q&gt; thing sounds like an extortion to me. nobody asks researchers to find bugs as well no one asks anybody to try the security of your front door. don&#039;t get me wrong. do I want to get paid more? hell yeh! the thing is that it is up to you if you want to sell it or not for the price that is offered. in other words, if I offer you $5 for an exploit it is up to you to decide if you want to have a deal or not.

some people think that my argument is that security researcher are already paid enough and they don&#039;t deserve to be paid more for their exceptional work. this is incorrect. my opinion is that although you, as a security researcher, dictate the price of your work, at the end of the day it is all business. you can ask for any sum you can imagine but if no one is willing to buy it at that price you will loose. and asking 75K from a legit company for a vulnerability which could be leaked tomorrow is not the way to go. it is a high risk investment no one will bother to get into. as a businessman, if I give you 75K for a vulnerability I would like to see first of all return of that investment and perhaps even a bit of profit. the only people that will buy at that price are either military institutions (only if inline with the current budget and objectives) or shady figures from around the Internet who will use your work to expand their botnets.</description>

		<description>* Thinking that some corporations buying &quot;0days&quot; are better or have better ethics soil than others could kill you from naiveness. 
* Also, that idea, gives the &#039;prefered&#039; corp the right to put whatever price they want to your research.
* The authors r not all the time being the ones selling the shit to &#039;fill-with-gov-you-hate&#039;. Authors sell IP rights.</description>

		<description>&quot;Do you remember the numerous gaming sweatshops which sprung up like wild mushrooms after the recent heavy rains in 3rd-world countries? I recall seeing a documentary on a typical day in a Chinese WoW sweatshop. I remember I saw a room full of almost naked people...&quot;

&quot;Finally, I know that a lot of people are into the security business because of all the romanticism and the myths surrounding the hacker figure&quot;

Which is it then? People also makes shoes and clothes by hand in sweatshops, that doesn&#039;t take much intelligence either. If the same people who get paid 70$ a month to put strings in shoes are also writing expoits, doesn&#039;t that kind of take the whole &quot;romanticism&quot; and &quot;elitism&quot; of being a &quot;hacker&quot; and throw it out the window?</description>

		<description>first of all, very interesting post. lots of ideas flowing in all directions which is definitely a positive thing.

personally, regarding selling vulns, i rather avoid unknown buyers, and stick to programs like ZDI. yes, ZDI will pay you MUCH less than a company which will force you to sign an NDA, but i think it&#039;s worth it, considering that you know who you&#039;re dealing with. prob. the only other type of entity i would sell vulns to, besides programs like ZDI, is the government. And even then you gotta really think about what government you&#039;re selling it too as it can actually screw up your career due to international politics. ie: .uk researcher selling vulns + working exploits to the .cn government.

Regarding &#039;hacker&#039; romanticism, pentesting, exploit writing and vuln research in general are nothing other than 1) spotting the crap that other people forgot to clean, and 2) proving that not cleaning your crap can lead to a problem.

Although i love offensive security in general, i must say that sometimes i feel like changing careers and becoming a hotel manager in sunny southern spain :) Security research is very interesting, but no one gives a darn ultimately.</description>

		<description>In my humble opinion this is unlikely scenario. Writing a successful BOF exploit nowadays is much tougher than years ago. Now you&#039;ve got things like ASLR, NX pages, canary values on the stack, SELinux and stuff. Provided that you are not likely to find memory pages that are executable and writable, you don&#039;t know the exact address of your shellcode (because memory layout is randomized) and you just can&#039;t overrun the return address on the stack cause you don&#039;t know the canary value, today writing BOF exploits (at least on linux) is a kind of art. Still possible, but much harder and sometimes not reliable. Come on, it&#039;s 2009 now. Aleph1&#039;s times are long gone (and for good IMO). Don&#039;t know about the Microsoft world though, probably it&#039;s easier there. 

Thus, I don&#039;t think a couple of underpaid Chinese &#039;hackers&#039; will be so much productive in that aspect.

Although, as far as web vulnerabilities are concerned, I totally agree with you that&#039;s a very possible scenario. Web application vulnerabilities are generally much more easier to exploit.</description>

		<description>[HD filipino research team] i belive  finding bugs is art :) i personally believe China is better in this part.

[Fuzzer&#039;s] yes but India is complete different jungle, You can hire bunch of engineering guys but minimum wage will be like 250 to 300$ per month those kind of profit making market you mentioned is long gone. but to my knowledge army is hiring hackers to develop exploits ;)</description>

		<description>Raaka, thanks for the comment. Which aspect of HD comments you are agreeing with? Also, I apologize giving India as an example. I know many gifted security guys from there and I have a high respect for your education system. I also referred to people from eastern Europe, where I am from, to be fair. :) the fact though, is that India is a one of the perfect places for outsourcing things at a cheaper rate... 

Now, coding exploits has nothing to do with finding bugs... seriously... especially when all you want to achieve is a crash which can be replicated. It doesn&#039;t require any special knowledge to write fuzzers or fuzz test software. at least, this is my humble opinion. My example was vague but based on other similar types of business models, i.e. WoW sweatshops, as I mentioned.

There are many other points in the article. Let&#039;s not ignore them.</description>

		<description>I agree with HD, i am from India people are good with computers but not with security here.

I can guarantee people with this idea cant survive here.

also math is different if you are Security guy&amp; you could code exploits you charge minimum of 500 to 1000$ per month:)</description>
