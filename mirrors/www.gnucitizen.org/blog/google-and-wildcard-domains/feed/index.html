		<description>Right, but Google doesn&#039;t have to respond to that hostname.  Through HTTP, they could choose to give you a 404 error, as I&#039;m sure they do.</description>

		<description>Pdp means that if *.acme.com points to Blogspot, you can go to Blogspot and occupy blog.acme.com. The wildcard is entered in the DNS, and not at Blogspot.</description>

		<description>jtyrrell is right, http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=55373

I Notes they say:

You can use this feature with domains (e.g. mysite.com) or subdomains (e.g. name.mysite.com). However, you cannot specify subdirectories (e.g. mysite.com/blog/) or wildcards (e.g. *.mysite.com).

		<description>I haven&#039;t used Blogspot, but from the services I&#039;ve seen, you must first tell Google the value of the CNAME before creating the record.  If you enter a wildcard into that field, it tells you that *&#039;s aren&#039;t allowed.

This is so that ghs.google.com can respond to an HTTP query properly according to the Host: header that the client sends.  If an unknown Host is submitted, Google simply sends back a 404 error.

So you&#039;re saying this really isn&#039;t the case with Blogspot?  Oversight indeed....</description>

		<description>This isn&#039;t anything knew Ive seen tricks done to get access to a domain gmail account. Such as @whatever.com you just trick your way into verifying and now you have the a email address with somebodys domain you can do alot of things with just a bit of that. And the image is cool in my book.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m of the opinion that wildcards are simple a bad idea for security in general, and pointing them at IP addresses you don&#039;t control is just plain stupid.

So have you seriously seen an administrator who thinks it&#039;s a good idea to let someone control subdomains that are under their DNS?

The ghs.google.com domain doesn&#039;t seem to suffer this problem, however if you were to point the wildcard at a working domain then you are also trusting that that domain does not have xss holes.</description>
