		<description>I would like to confront the &quot;holiman&quot; by expressing an opinion opposite to the common understanding that there is &quot;no magic&quot;. There is magic and it is very real. Magic is when you find something first! By the time you understand things a.k.a. &quot;magic&quot; more &quot;magic&quot; is being created, by magicians of course not by you. :) Same applies to so called tools. I am really enjoying myself when I read about so called &quot;security&quot; exploits. The real security exploits are never made public. System compromises that are worth mentioning are never made public also. What is published on the Internet is a waste of time. And ouch :) Google is not your friend.</description>

		<description>You are *so* right. And not just for pen-testing, but all aspects of software development. Developers (or, more commonly, managers) stare themselves blind at tools and acronyms, which is why CV:s usually are mostly long lists of tools. 

I try to live by the motto: &quot;There is no magic&quot;. If I find that a particular tool contains &quot;magic&quot;, I need to dispel that magic by finding out how it works - and by understanding it I will be able to do it myself if that particular tool should not work.</description>

		<description>Very true. I can&#039;t remember the times I&#039;ve struggled with a seemingly simple (but boring and tedious) computing operation that I would have done in, say, 10 minutes manually, but instead spending several times more fooling around with more sophisticated tools. One easy thing that works for me in this cases -- when you&#039;re going to experiment with an allegedly &quot;time-saving&quot; tool, specify a time limit for playing with it to get the right result. I&#039;d probably set it at something like 30-70% of the available time, just to have a margin for still doing it the &#039;stupid&#039; way.</description>
