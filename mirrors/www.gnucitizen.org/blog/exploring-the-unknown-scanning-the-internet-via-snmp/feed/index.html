		<description>i am currently writing a tool to manipulate snmp i am writing it in c# the reason for this is simple i cannot do certain things i need to in linux scripting for that matter and its just easier this way it will be impressive</description>

		<description>These are for sure not something new quite alot of ppl can own almost any box running snmp.

to my expriance (90% success having read access) (20% with having any access)

base on their implimantation flaws causing overflows,avs,and very funny implimantaion of access control ,its not hard to elevate read access or even just to write to password oid  using READONLY access , for many, you can edit arp cache to your benefit with low access level , for some other utilize tftp to extract private password from config binary. not going to argue more .just seach the net see for yourself . or apply a general fuzzer.

btw: i was searching for private oid logo for assigned oids to use in some freeware . anybody care to share ?

Thanks</description>

		<description>@defcon: there are many SNMP scanners for Linux out there implemented in Perl i.e.: http://www.ernw.de/download/snmpattack.pl. 

You can even write a &quot;home-made&quot; one in bash by wrapping around the &#039;snmpget&#039; (from the net-snmp package) command and requesting the &#039;system description&#039; OID.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been working on SNMP security for some time now its definitely an interesting subject with lots of potential.

Side-note: I can&#039;t seem find the link to the paper?

		<description>@Digicat: You&#039;re right. The WinXP agents claims to be &quot;Windows 2000&quot; but still leak the fact that they&#039;re XP by revealing the &quot;5.1&quot; version rather than &quot;5.0&quot;. And you&#039;re also right when you say that there was one Win 2K3 box (5.2): 

&quot;Hardware: x86 Family 6 Model 15 Stepping 6 AT/AT COMPATIBLE - Software: Windows Version 5.2 (Build 3790 Uniprocessor Free)&quot;

However, it&#039;s still correct to say that most Windows boxes found were Windows 2000 (5.0).

Funny enough there was also a Win98 box?!! I wonder if it&#039;s a honey pot: &quot;Microsoft Corp. Windows 98.&quot;</description>

		<description>The hits reported as Windows 2000 are also Windows XP.  Windows XP claims Windows 2000 but reports version 5.1 build 2600 on the same line.  There was also one Windows 2003 that reported as Windows 2000 version 5.2 .  It looks like a handful (likely larger since this is only a sampling) of unwise Windows XP users installated SNMP, and then opened that in Windows Firewall, or otherwise didn&#039;t implement Windows Firewall.</description>

		<description>Sure, I see snmp services being advertised all the time. I also use google to search then out.  Communities are used for auth, trying the default is no different from trying the default at a  telnet password prompt. CMA sunshine.</description>

		<description>Dear Judge Dredd, you&#039;ve accessed this GNUCITIZEN post without authorization. Please explain, or will take legal actions against your unethical, intrusive behavior.

Here is how your actions reflect on the computer misuse act:

1) He causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in a computer;
  - you&#039;ve tried to compromise our systems by submitting meta characters such as &quot;, &lt;, &gt; and &#039;, things that can potentially lead to SQL Injection and backend compromise.

2) the access he intends to secure is unauthorized; and
  - we have never gave you any sort of authorization. We never give such privilege to trolls. We have never give you authorization to post meta characters on this post or to access the GNUCITIZEN domain.

3) he knows at the time when he causes the computer to perform the function that this is the case. 
  - your intentions are more then clear.

		<description>I Judge Dredd condemn you under article:

1(1) of computer misuse act 1990
A person is guilty of an offence if:

    a) He causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in a computer;
    b) the access he intends to secure is unauthorized; and
    c) he knows at the time when he causes the computer to perform the function that this is the case. 

you&#039;ve used known default passwords to access other information without authorization, thus securing vital/security related information.

this is equivalent to using default admin passwords on an insecure website, and retrieving sensitive information or performing defacement.

JD&gt;&quot;How do you plead&quot;;
GNUC&gt;&quot;Innocent!!!!&quot;
JD&gt;&quot;How did I know you&#039;d say that, I find you Guilty under all 3&quot;

		<description>@sniffz: if your model is NOT listed as vulnerable does NOT mean is NOT. Pasted from page 2 in the paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Other ZyXEL models not mentioned in this paper might also be vulnerable to the same issues discussed. Additionally, not all ZyXEL models mentioned in this paper have been tested for the same vulnerabilities due to time constraints and lack of full unrestricted access (i.e.: full administrative access was not possible during a penetration test).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I recommend you reading the manual for your model in order to find out how to change the default SNMP community strings, or restrict SNMP access from trusted IP addresses only: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zyxel.com/DownloadLibary_ShortName/P-660H-61/user_guide/P-660H-61_3-40(QT).pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zyxel.com/DownloadLibary_ShortName/P-660H-61/user_guide/P-660H-61_3-40(QT).pdf&lt;/a&gt;</description>
