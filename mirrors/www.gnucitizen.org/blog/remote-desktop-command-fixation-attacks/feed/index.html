		<description>Most terminal servers I set up are restricted too, so the user can&#039;t run cmd.exe and evil.exe, only a set of programs specified... of course one of those because of business requirements is Internet Explorer, so game over right there. It is an interesting exploit, but not one that would necessarily work 100% of the time. Could you just MIM them, ie change the citrix/rdp to connect to a server on your network through port 443, then you redirect and capture their user/pass.</description>

		<description>Isn&#039;t most Citrix-servers set up to NOT allow users to install or execute unknown applications? Will the user be allowed to execute cmd.exe and download and run an unknown file?</description>

		<description>An easy way to defend this is with an IPS that will shun RDP traffic on 3389 or detecting RDP over a non standard port. 

There is a rule on Bleeding Snort to do this.</description>

		<description>I&#039;am a little curious - why should my firewall policies allow to forward such outbound connections - and moreover - why should i expose my rdp/ica servers without additional protection (e.g. VPN/certificates) to the outside.

Security comes with layers of it.

		<description>If you truly believe security in depth (defense in depth is the common usage), then what are you envisioning? That we have one perfect security measure that is unbreakable? I&#039;m not sure about you, but with the rest of the security industry, it is pretty accepted that there is no silver bullet.

We need and will always need layered defense in order to protect data and systems when one layer is thwarted.

You might say that people will always be a weak link, and that could be true even in an environment with security in depth. In fact, security in depth is even more needed due to the human factor. If people can make stupid mistakes, put up roadblocks, nets, and pointy objects in their way so they don&#039;t stupidly make those mistakes...

Perhaps you have a different definition of &quot;security in depth,&quot; in which case I beg that you explain it so that everyone can move beyond focusing on that statement. Maybe we&#039;re really on the same page and just have different meanings to this rather common security term...</description>

		<description>Before I saw rkd&#039;s message I went to test the Outlook attachment stripping on Outlook 2003 and it does not strip .rdp files. 

I see that the attack has a hard IP address in it, and of course the attacker would need to know either a name or address. In a corporation this is likely to be a gateway I guess and not a big secret.

I also noticed the &quot;working directory:s:C:\&quot;. Some of us don&#039;t have download and execute rights in our root directories. Is there a more elegant approach to this? Is %TEMP% supported here?</description>

		<description>hey i posted about something like this on my blog:
http://fazed-darkstar.blogspot.com/2007/10/phishing-windows-passwords-with-citrix.html

it basically rely&#039;s on social engineering.
but this is a bit more indepth, nice!</description>

		<description>Any email that urges you to &quot;click this&quot; is a potential attack vector. The barn door was opened when email morphed beyond delivering plain ASCII text. The solution is to block any email that is not plain ASCII. Since users cry when you take their candy away, computers will never be secure. End of story. Get used to it.</description>

		<description>rkd, because the attacker may simply include a link to a remote RDP/ICA file which the user will click on. Of course it gets more suspicious but users will still fall for it. No to mention that RDP and ICA can be delivered to the target in multiple ways.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Filter emails and email content and in general traffic that contains RDP or ICA files. Yes it sounds simple, but it is almost impossible to implement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I hate to be asking an obvious question but why is it that filtering *.rdp/*.ica (or whatever the ica extension is) is impossible?
As far as I know Outlook 2007 (the client itself) strips this attachments by itself...</description>

		<description>djteller, :) yeh right. first of all you have to educate the administrators. What I am trying to show here is how easy it is sometimes to gain remote access without too much effort. The security community and industry in general is sooo much into vulnerability research that they forget to look at the most obvious, the most simplistic, and the most successful threats. Who needs 0days when Andrea Johnson, the secretary from 3rd floor, will unawarely let you in?

Moreover, most people have never heard of Windows Terminal services. The don&#039;t know how they even look like. So, what&#039;s going to happen if the attacker just spawns a full-screen session on their desktop? They will probably think that somehow they logged out; type their username and password, and of course let the attacker in. Simple and effective.</description>
