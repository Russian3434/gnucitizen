		<description>Yes I think you should inform the owner before you publish or you are just contributing to the problem. So that would make you just as guilty as the people causing all the problems on the net today. But on the other hand its people like you all that help keep the net safe just be responsable with your powers are you doing it for good or evil.</description>

		<description>Thor,

I don&#039;t think anyone here is saying you should bury the research. We all know that security through obscurity is a fallacy. However, asking you to delay publishing an exploit for a day or two is certainly not unreasonable. It helps protect the users more than the author.

Premature publishing of explicit exploit information is one of the ways that &quot;zero-day&quot; problems become widespread. As a user of Firebug I&#039;d rather you had talked to Joe first. Actually as a user of any software I&#039;d rather you give it&#039;s author a chance to patch before publishing exploits.

If you feel you must post immediately, post the information that the vulnerability exists and some basic details without the full &quot;how-to&quot; and follow up later with the full disclosure.

There are certainly times where it&#039;s appropriate to use disclosure as a means to force action, but give the author a reasonable chance to respond. It&#039;s better for all of us.

James.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don&#039;t think there is anything extreme about publishing a vulnerability when you find it. sure, Joe could have been away for the Easter holiday visiting his family and therefor not been able to patch it immediately, but I fail to see how that is my concern. In that regards I have treated him no worse or better than I have treated Microsoft, Mozilla or Valve in the past.

This is research that pdp and I have independently performed. We&#039;re not employees of Microsoft or Firebug, instead we are altruistically researching and publishing the very things that others are also researching - but keeping private.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

		<description>[...] Yesterday pdp from gnucitizen.org wrote once again a very interesting blog posting. He found out, that the widely used Firefox extension called Firebug has a vulnerability which allows an attacker to execute his own JavaScript code. Yes I know, weâ€™ve talked about XSS and all that stuff many times but this vulnerability is much more dangerous than normal ones. This because Firefox extensions are running in a part of the webbrowser whichâ€™s called chrome. Because of being in the chrome, the Firefox extensions there have much more privileges and possibilities than normal JavaScript on a website has. For example such an extension can read/write files on the harddisk, open sockets, install malware and much more. Now in the case we have here with Firebug, an attacker can exactly do what Iâ€™ve just described.The following line shows the problem in a very nice way: console.log({&#8217;&lt;script&gt;alert(&#8221;Evil Script&#8221;)&lt;/script&gt;&#8217;:&#039;exploit&#8217;}) [...]</description>

		<description>[...] It has tones of useful features like a dynamic console, DOM tree explorer, CSS viewer/editor, script explorer and network monitor where you can see all Flash, XMLHttpRequest, JS and Image requests. Firebug is mainly used by web developers to trace bugs in their code but it can also be used to find and explore various browser and remote site vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, Firebug suffers from rather simple but quite dangerous vulnerability. The vulnerability is of a type Cross-zone or Cross-context scripting, where a script from a web pages in injected inside the zone of the browser, also know as the chrome, or in the zone of the file: protocol. In both cases the result is quite devastating, although the second is a bit less critical then the first. Remote scripts in the browser are restricted by a sandbox. This means that everything that is prefixed with http: or https: is secure. Browser extensions make use of the chrome: protocol. This protocol is not restricted at all and everything is allowed. Therefor browser extensions are trusted. However if a remote script, tricks the browser into executing JavaScript expressions on chrome: then this script can take control of the entire chrome and also the underplaying operating system because then command execution and read/write file access are allowed.

		<description>Randolph, so you are saying that you want to detect Firebug remotely? Right now, this is a bit difficult.

If you want to detect Firebug version without going into Firefox, but still being local, you can just read the install.rdf file from Firebug extension folder which is under the Firefox profile folder.</description>

		<description>&quot;I don&#039;t think there is anything extreme about publishing a vulnerability when you find it.&quot;

You put software users unnecessarily at risk. That&#039;s what&#039;s wrong with it.

&quot;I fail to see how that is my concern&quot;

Yep, there you go.

You are not &quot;altruistically researching&quot; anything when you don&#039;t consider what&#039;s best for the end users?

There aren&#039;t just two parties involved in these bug reports -- the software developer and the security researcher -- there is a third group with interests at stake: the thousands, if not millions of end users who are vulnerable.

You&#039;re right that you don&#039;t owe Joe Hewitt anything (though I would opine it would be nice if you extended common courtesy). And you also deserve credit for finding this security hole.

But you do a huge disservice to all the everyday users like me when you dismiss the possibility that &quot;Joe could have been away for the Easter holiday visiting his family and therefor not been able to patch it immediately&quot;.</description>

We often need to take extreme routes to make a point otherwise nobody would listen. However, I knew that Joe Hewitt will patch Firebug very quickly because the extension has one of the cleanest source code structures I have ever seen.</description>

		<description>The above exploit has been fixed as well. Joe is very responsive and I thought it would be worth posting his response on the last link here as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Joe Hewitt  says:
April 6th, 2007 at 3:44

I have fixed this issue and and released 1.04.

As you suggested, I now escape all text before inserting it into HTML, rather than leaving it up to the caller. I&#039;ve also added support for disabling file: urls.

I hope there aren&#039;t any more vulnerabilities to be found, but if there are, please give me a day to patch it before you publish. I do appreciate you taking the time to make Firebug more secure, but it&#039;s better for everyone to have the patch surface before the exploit.

It is a good think that Firefox has an automatic update system, so every Firebug user should be secured within a few days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
