		<description>Sven, I see your point but as I said, the framework is not ready yet. So, what you are going to need it for when you cannot use it? Now, I am not completely sure whether the ported exploits work because I haven&#039;t personally invested time to check that, but I will as soon as I get some other stuff out of my way.

I know that it sounds a bit like... &lt;q&gt;hei guys my stuff work and they are awesome. check them out.&lt;/q&gt;... sort of showing off, but, that was not my intention, indeed, there are some exploits ported and for sure they will get on this website as soon as the framework is completed.</description>

		<description>Hi pdp,

wouldn&#039;t it be possible for your friend to make at least one ported exploit public? It would be great to have an example, which can inspire other people out there to do the same thing :)

Regards,
