		<description>crash_daemonicus,

I totally agree with you, however you can still get certain parts of the file if the information that you are interested in is somewhere at the top of the file. The way you do that is by importing the file as script and watching for errors. Some JS interpreters return not only the type of error that is generated but also the actual code line, which is exactly what you are after.</description>

		<description>I guess another classic example of information disclosure would be using res&#058;// calls to DLL&#039;s to load images only there in certain versions of windows and then testing the image&#039;s width and height information with javascript...

PS. last post my example HTML didnt post:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;script src=C:\file.ext&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

		<description>well, unless your target file is a configuration file that would be in correct syntax as a JS file.... then you simply  and call each configuration variable by name

but anymore it&#039;d be difficult unless your target is a specific program&#039;s configuration file because anymore they have [type of information]  lines that will kill the script

but if they dont then there might be a problem lol</description>

		<description>Do all the attack functions work if IE or FF are runing inside of something like SandBoxIE?

Does the attack also try to work on a Virtual machine?</description>

		<description>My problem is that i have IIS and a virtual directory... could you please tell me if it is possible to use an iframe to get a html page from, for example, c:\test\x.htm... Be aware that my VD is different from the c:\test.



Thank you so much.

		<description>Yes anty,

You are right. The reason I presented it this way was because sometimes JRE is not installed in which case you cannot read binary files, but you can read text files with iframe. It it the same when listing directories. Also, you can use the XMLHttpRequest object, however, to me it seams that it works on some setups but it doesn&#039;t on others.

Yes, this technique works only when the file is executed locally due to the same origin policy. It will not work remotely unless you find a browser bug but this is a completely different story.

However, there are situations where a plugin or an extension unconsciously caches web content on the file system and presents it to the user. This was the case with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/cross-context-scripting-with-sage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sage cross-context scripting vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.

The complete sourcode of the techniques presented here are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/attackapi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AttackAPI project page&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
