		<description>Hi, Is it by chance related to Web security gateway software (Web filtering), aka Internet content-control ?</description>

		<description>I know some of my favorite vuln finds are serendipitous ones. That&#039;s always awesome.

On a side note, your finding wouldn&#039;t happen to have anything to do with the huge pile of Cisco advisories that went out today, would it?</description>

		<description>Sure there is always a possibility that someone else can find the same vulnerability. I wouldn&#039;t be so naive to think I&#039;m the only one who found it. 

However, I must warn you that this vuln is a *weird one*. In fact I discovered it by pure accident. I&#039;m planning to explain what lead me to discover it at HITBSecConf, because it&#039;s actually kind of a funny story ;)</description>

		<description>You&#039;re right, I should have been more clear. I ment selling it to irresponsible groups or individuals who have some bad intentions with it. 

What about my concern? I know it&#039;s possibly impossible to answer correct, but if you have to make a guess, what are the chances that this vuln is already found (and abused) by someone else? 
Without revealing the details on howto, is there a way to check if someone has been a victim of the vuln? Or are there no traces at all? 
As you can notice, you post scared the sh*t out of me   :oÞ</description>

		<description>I&#039;d not think listing the vendor would fall into the realm &quot;irresponsible disclosure&quot; and I understand that disclosure is tricky business, and selling vulnerabilities is NOT always a bad thing. 

I&#039;ve deployed many different solutions for customers, so there&#039;s a good chance I have a client whose dick is hanging in the breeze because of this.  I just don&#039;t know which one(s). HITBSecConf is a long ways off. And people wonder why I get 15 hours of sleep per week.</description>

		<description>@FlipM: we shouldn&#039;t turn selling a vulnerability into a synonym for irresponsible disclosure. There are several *responsible* vulnerability disclosure programs which pay researchers. ZDI for instance is the one I used, which reported the vulnerability I found to the vendor. Of course, the details will only be available once a fix is released.</description>

		<description>@NurBo: At least Adrian is taking the appropriate steps after finding vulnerabilities, instead of abusing (or even selling!) them. 

But I am concerned. If Adrian found this one, who else found the same? And when? Did someone already abused any of my systems? We&#039;ll know after HITBSecConf Malaysia...</description>

		<description>guys, as I said I can&#039;t provide full details at this point, even though I would love to! I simply wanted to share what I could regarding the new material which I will present at HITBSecConf Malaysia.</description>

		<description>There will never be a good way of disclosing vulnerabilities! At least we try to give you the heads up that an issue exists. The more inform you are the better decisions you can make.</description>

		<description>From a responsible disclosure standpoint, I would much rather have gotten the name of a product family than a list of bad stuff that this vulnerability exposes users to. Now I have to sit around wondering if any of the firewall appliances I&#039;ve deployed are &quot;the one&quot; and throw extra wide-spectrum effort at the problem despite if I&#039;m actually affected or not.</description>
