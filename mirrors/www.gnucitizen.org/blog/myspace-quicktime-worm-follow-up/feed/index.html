		<description>i get plagued by phished people everyday. even ads that are less then legal. quiet a majority of the phished people i encounter actually still have access to there account, and are unaware that some phisher is sending ads around to there friends, i would certainly hate to find out that im in trouble because a phisher was making my accouunt send ilegal ads out to everyone.

all phishing sites where they ask for your login to steal dont actually say http://www.myspace.com
but they usually look extremely similar. such as
http://www.rnyspace.com

system errors caused by a website are virtually impossible without C++. and C++ cant just be used normally like html or java in the first place. You may want to consider the possibility of a virus or major program corruption, such as quicktime is corrupted.

i would just like to point out that a mac is much more insecure then a windows machine. ive worked with macs before and they are pathetic security wise. windows recieves probrably 80/100 bad hacker being the leading computer in the market, i think mac would crash and burn in windows place right now.

in other words its in your best interest to have good virus protection on a mac too.</description>

		<description>i didnt click on any quicktime thingy. but i get an error page whenever i try to log on to myspace. i can browse but i cant click on anyones pics/ comments ect .....i get a server error/systems error page everytime. I have to go to internet cafs to log on now. I tried using a different server but still the same thing.I&#039;m on a mac, so its very doubtful its a virus...if anyone has any clues, they would be much appreciated!</description>

		<description>I joined Myspace just over a week ago now and I got a message saying that it was found that my system had QUICKTIME PLAYER and that I neede an update in order to watch movies. 

I stupidly installed it thinking this message was coming from the techs at myspace. A day or so later mt windows XP shut down - blue screen saying it closed down and some figures etc. It did so a few times and then I concentrated where I was on the web when it stopped. Well it is everytime I go to Myspace site. Not necessarily into my account but even if I&#039;m just browsing at Myspace window XP stopps with an error message.

Exasperating stuff. Is there any I can do to overcome or rid me of this problem?

Thanks
Nick D

Where can I read a response to this? Can someone email me please.</description>

		<description>[...] So we changed a lot of diapers last year. Simple things we do suddenly have become very dangerous and risky. If you think that user supplied Image files are safe, think again. There were several attacks affecting social networks and a couple of very successful AJAX worms, again affecting social networks, during the last year. However, it seams that we haven&#8217;t really scratch the surface yet. [...]</description>
