		<description>[...] In my previous posts I mentioned that in order to perform advance attacks the malicious script needs to implement the XMLHttpRequest object. I also mentioned that this can be achieved with Flash and Java as well, however none of the methods are perfect, since the browser implements cross domain scripting restrictions which disallow client scripts to perform operations on resources outside of their domain. One way to bypass this restriction is to exploit a XSS hole on the targeted domain and as such bypass the same origin policy. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] I saw a post this morning point to a fiction story over at Michael Daw&#8217;s website about how XSS can be used to steal national secrets. It&#8217;s based loosely off of the concepts that Jeremiah built and it references pdp (architect)&#8217;s paper on XSSing the Lan. Basically this is just a sensationalist outlook of what is possible, but it&#8217;s still an interesting narrative. [...]</description>
