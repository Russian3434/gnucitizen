		<description>My original tests were a failure but now when you are saying that it is possible I must have a second look at this issue. Thanks, man.</description>

		<description>pdp,

Unfortunately I do not have the HTML stored, because they fixed it too quickly. Fortunately I had taken this snapshot. But I&#039;m sure many Indians have seen that flag that day. URL decoded version looks like this

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;www.orkut.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.bandeirasanimadas.com/Asia/India/3dflagsdotcom_india_2fawm.gif&quot;

		<description>pdp and RSnake. Why do you think, that cookies theft don&#039;t work with this attack vector. As I tested the alert(document.cookie) script is working fine and you may see cookie (and so you may steal it).

You just need to put a link with appropriate (encrypted) data in href attribute on site. And than cookies tricks will be possible in current domain.</description>

		<description>Hi superlone,

As far as I know IE6 and IE7 does not support data URLs. However, I believe that this is quite useful feature that could benefit many AJAX applications. I won&#039;t be surprised if Microsoft implements data URLs or similar mechanism some day.

Again, although it is quite useful, keep in mind that this can be used in very bad ways.</description>

		<description>This reminds me of the old functionality (now disabled) in Netscape&#039;s about: &quot;protocol&quot;.  Circa &#039;98 I used to set the start pages on my high school&#039;s machines to &quot;about:Hi [the admin&#039;s name]!&quot; or something stupid like that.

		<description>Nice work pdp! Another reminder that we shouldn&#039;t trust anything when we go online.

Here is my personal recipe for those users that are paranoid:

- go online using restricted-user privileges
- use a browser extension which allows you to whitelist which domains are allowed to run scripting (i.e.: Firefox&#039;s NoScript)
- use common sense!

Will keep checking your site regularly pdp!</description>

		<description>RSnake, I didn&#039;t even know this attack vector was in your cheat sheet and I have been through it loads of times - A table of contents might be cool.

pdp, cool paper.. I think this area needed additional light and explanation.

I would like to think that any half decent application filter should be able to decode base64 and check it for script tags, but heck, who am I kidding :)</description>

		<description>Hi Denver,

I stated that it doesn&#039;t work in IE6 and IE7. I don&#039;t quite agree that it is harmless for reasons I have already discussed in this post.</description>

		<description>RSnake, would you like to describe in more detaila what do you mean with &quot;building CSRF tools&quot;. CSRF - cross site request forgery - I suppose.

Thanks</description>

The browser shows that &quot;the page can not be displayed&quot;. Even if it works, all this is harmless, just useless tricks.. I cannot get remote control, cannnot install files remotely, cannot change/delete html pages..</description>

		<description>RSnake,

I am not claiming it is new. In fact I clearly stated in my post that some of you may already be familiar with it. Apparently you are.

To be honest with you, cookie theft is probably one of least things I am interested in. Data URLs are brilliant for enabling very powerful attacks. I am surprised that they have been covered so vaguely in past. There is so much potential in them.

I am quite concerned about JavaScript tools being able to assemble PDF and DOC documents on the fly. What about worms that carry their payloads in a single URL? IMHO this is a serious security issue.</description>
