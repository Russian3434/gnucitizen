		<description>Yes interesting, I decided to write my own version:

This only works in localhost
 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;lol = document.createElement(&#039;iframe&#039;);
lol.src = &#039;http://tinyurl.com/ym7yba&#039;;
document.body.appendChild(lol);

function printCODE()
{
code = lol.contentDocument.location + &#039;&#039;;

if(code)
 {
 body = document.getElementById(&#039;code&#039;);
 code = unescape(code);
 body.innerHTML = code.substr(28, code.length-18);
 }
 else
 {
 alert(&#039;error&#039;);
 }
}

setInterval(&quot;printCODE()&quot;, 3000);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

		<description>maluc,

I tried to be ironic. tinyurl does have persistent XSS but I am not disclousing that, and it doesn&#039;t matter anyway. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;And you say it&#039;s to use for remote storage, but what sort of example storage would a javascript worm need? i mean, i can&#039;t think of a way to load any dynamic flash or file like this with IE. Like can you think of a sample attack using it? i&#039;m just drawing a blank..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is easy. Get the base64 value and append the following in front of it: data:application/x-shockwave-flash;base64,. Put that into an iframe src attribute and you have the flash running. This doesn&#039;t work on IE though. More on that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/self-contained-xss-attacks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/a-bag-full-of-tricks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... but there&#039;s a lot of ways to use remote storage ... you can put it on any site that allows user content&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes I agree on that, but I want something that is more agile, as I said in this post. I want to create a virtual file system that the agent can operate without requiring assistance. This is where tinyurl shines: everyone is free to shrink, no registration is required.</description>

		<description>Actually, tinyurl does have a persistent XSS. So i think the more accurate sentence would be &quot;This does NOT use an XSS on tinyurl.&quot;

And you say it&#039;s to use for remote storage, but what sort of example storage would a javascript worm need? i mean, i can&#039;t think of a way to load any dynamic flash or file like this with IE. Like can you think of a sample attack using it? i&#039;m just drawing a blank..

It&#039;s a good idea if it does have some use.. but there&#039;s alot of ways to use remote storage. For example, putting it on a myspace page.. then using your double proxy iframes method to extract it. You can put it on anyy site that allows user content - forums, comments, wordpress, etc. Assuming it can handle the bandwidth of a worm.
