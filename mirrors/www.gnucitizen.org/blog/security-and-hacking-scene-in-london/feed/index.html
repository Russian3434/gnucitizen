		<description>I agree that it is difficult to get the attention of the security community as they have the commerical challenges and priorities. Delaney Consulting have lined up some intermediate level security courses at weekends to try and address the work/life demands. I would be interested in coming along to your meetings...in my experience it can take a long time fo these groups to become popular and then bang, out of nowhere you&#039;ve the other problem of not having enough room to fit them all. Keep up the good work.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m currently studying in London and want to join in on these type of events, but I to find that they are not normally well advertised. Perhaps I&#039;m looking in the wrong areas? Or I find out about them after they happened.</description>

		<description>@pdp - glad you like the slides :) . btw, I talked to R. Marcos yesterday and he said he&#039;d send me the slides. I will add a link ASAP.

@fazed - True they are not advertised enough. I think dc4420 got it right by sending posts to security mailing lists such as Full Disclosure. I think that really helps people remembering the next meeting date.

@Arkan - you just missed the dc4420 drinking party yesterday!</description>

		<description>Having started the OWASP London chapter and sorted a few london meetings, I can tell you it&#039;s a damn hard job.

The problem with london is that everyone is busy, and after a long day you often feel like going home and relaxing with the family/wife/girlfriend/boyfriend etc. 

It sucks, i wish it was more like the US side of things, but it&#039;s a price you pay for being in such an aggressive market</description>

		<description>Well, I&#039;m a security professional living in working in London (not getting paid a very good salary though!) My only excuse is that usually we (me and colleagues) are too busy to attend.. We always talk about attending to OWASP and 2600 meetings and we even place it on our schedules but then when the day comes, it&#039;s always a client work or a deadline that gets the priority.. Still, we would like to join and will try our best to show up in Picadilly for the next 2600 meeting!

Cheers,
Arkan</description>
