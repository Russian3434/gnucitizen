<p>Clickjacking is an oldie but, a goodie. You can track the origin of the attack back at the beginning of this decade. Clickjacking is essentially the anti-CSRF killer. It is also the killer of Flash, AJAX (because AJAX apps are sometimes easier to clickjack, look at Google) and some other technologies. [...]</p>
