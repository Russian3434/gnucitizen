	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>Fuzzing is a quite important for security researchers mainly because it helps going through the boring stuff quickly. Generally speaking, fuzzers are tools for automation. Unfortunately most moderns fuzzers are a lot more then automation tools. They are big, bloated and most of all, highly unusable, imho. And if you want to do some fuzzing, first of all you have to learn how they were built, and this is not a trivial thing. [...]</p>

The idea is that if somone skimmed your magnetic stripe, they won&#8217;t be able to make a purchase without your PIN. Of course, in reality most of the skimmed magstripes are simply being shipped to countries where Chip-and-PIN-like systems haven&#8217;t been rolled out yet, which means that criminals will be able to make purchases without knowing your PIN.

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>Although London enjoys one of the most vibrant infosec industries in the world, there are not as many hacker and security events and one would think. Meetings-wise, we have organizations such as 2600, Defcon, and Owasp among others. However, the number of attendees needs to be improved. Usually, having a turnup of 20 people on one of these meetings is considered a success in London. Not much for such a big city if you think about it. [...]</p>

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>What is this post about? Well, this is something that pdp and I were playing with a few years ago. As you might already know, although we also do a vulnerability research at GNUCITIZEN, what we like the best is insecurity by design. There is nothing better than finding an attack vector that won&#8217;t be resolved by the vendor simply because the product is designed to follow certain behavior. Personally, from a security research point of view, I think that these attacks are the best. [...]</p>

Nothing new, but kudos for the effort and for bringing this subject to light again. I wouldn&#8217;t have done it myself. However, Thom has forgot to release the actual sources of the SWF object.

My flight was early in the morning so I needed to give myself a slack of a couple of hours so that I feel safe that I wont miss the joy of the long and rather exhausting flight.
