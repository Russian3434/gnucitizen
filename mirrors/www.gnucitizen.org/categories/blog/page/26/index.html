	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>When we think of computer worms, we generally think about operating-system based worms such as the famous Code Red, which replicated itself 250,000 times in approximately nine hours on July 19, 2001. Its replication was made possible by a vulnerability within MS Windows platform. Firewalls and defense in depth help mitigate the spread of worms by providing layers of protection between public and private networks; however, a new age worm is upon us, the XSS Worm aka the Web 2.0 worm.

	<div class="post-excerpt"><p>A couple of days ago, Google unleashed a new product called Google Gears. At the beginning I was sceptical about the purpose and the actual benefit of this project but I soon realised that indeed it is very powerful and it does save developers from a lot of trouble when dealing with AJAXy applications. The two most useful/interesting Google Gears (GGears) features are the relational persistent storage and the worker pool. Both of these features are quite interesting. Let&#8217;s see why? [...]</p>

<p>To sum up, the Six Degrees of Separation depicts our small world. On average, everyone on this planet is reachable within six steps.
