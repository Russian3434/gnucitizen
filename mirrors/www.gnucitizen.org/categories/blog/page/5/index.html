<p>It is pointless to explain how the attack works. Go over the presentation slides or get the video/audio. What I would like to do is to present some of my thoughts regarding the attack and its impact. [...]</p>

<p>Basically the browser slowly becomes a quite powerful graphical environment. This is due to two relatively new features such as the canvas and support for SVG (Simply Vector Graphic). Interestingly enough, SVG is not so simple. [...]</p>
