		<description>Ryan, I see your point. However, I believe that there are still many similarities between both disciplines. Theoretically speaking, their main goal is to overcome every upcoming wave and to keep a balance on the board. This is just an allegory. Needles to say, if you want to be a really good surfer/crisis strategist, you just need to practise more.</description>

		<description>I understand what you&#039;re trying to get at- adaptability, but as a surfer you might want to learn how to surf and dedicate yourself to the lifestyle before you begin using comparisons. Comparing a beginner surfer to a person in charge of a billion dollar company loosing shareholder value is not analogous. And I love how you compare surfing and being attacked by a shark.</description>
