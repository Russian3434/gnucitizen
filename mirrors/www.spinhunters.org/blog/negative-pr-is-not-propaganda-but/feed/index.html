		<description>Dear Ayesha,
It&#039;s always great to hear that someone appreciates your work. Spin Hunters will be relaunch very soon , so stay tuned ! Meanwhile feel free to discuss the topic in your blog as well. Black PR is a very dangerous practise so the more we talk about it, the better the chances to stop and regulate this</description>

		<description>hi!
I was really amazed to read about your profession. I had no idea that there was such a great job out there. I am studying PR at the University of Westminster and if you don&#039;t mind then I would like to write my next reflection blog (http://ayeshasattarblog.wordpress.com/) about this job of yours :)</description>

		<description>@Muhhamed it is not very clear to me what the problem is, but as long as this information is spread only via emails you shouldn&#039;t worry much about it. The real problem comes when the pictures are resent to many other users at the same time. Otherwise it seems that this is just some kind of personal affair and you should contact a solicitor for more legal advices.</description>

		<description>i &#039;ve recently got a project, in which my client is facing personality challenge, at initial step it seems to me like, there is some friend or family, because my client&#039;s hubby name is turned as the email. There is no harrasment on the web as such but sending dirty pictures to friend and family via email is. Do you have any comment, how can I help her?</description>
