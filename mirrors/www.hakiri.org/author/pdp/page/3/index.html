For example, how do you know how many out of the 2000 followers are real people with opinion that is valuable to you or your community? You don&#8217;t know! Any newbie programmer can code up a simple script to post thoughts, retweet and sync feeds and do other things to the extend you no longer can differentiate between real and spammy traffic. [...]</p>
