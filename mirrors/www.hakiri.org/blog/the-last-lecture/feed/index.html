		<description>nice video, thanks, positive and funny

About that fake blog: I don&#039;t understand the fun of it or what the author tries to demonstrate. Just sick. The Ajax joke of last post is ridicolous.
rgod (I knew him on IRC and milw0rm) spoke fluently Italian (not translated from English like the blog one), English (well, some English) and ASM code and explained me lots of low level stuff. He was just noncurant of what his image reflected, I may suppose.

Finally, I miss the point of &quot;impersonating someone, who is dead&quot;. People do that normally, they simulate on IRC, not a thing to build papers about or threads on bugtraq. Just sick.</description>
