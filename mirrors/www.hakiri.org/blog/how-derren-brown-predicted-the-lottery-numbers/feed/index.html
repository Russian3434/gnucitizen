		<description>I was so annoyed at how people were fooled so easily asking; &quot;how did he predicted it&quot; but just as Joe Bloggs rightly said predicted something after its happened its a prediction.

		<description>I did not see any &quot;studio trickery&quot; going on and there were no cutaways or edits before he showed the number balls. He did mention perfecting this trick took &quot;a year of his life&quot;.

So, obviously it is an illusion but, I don&#039;t see how camera or studio tricks were involved and I have worked in the TV and film industry for most of my life. But, that could be the trick itself!

Either way, nice one.</description>

		<description>It was obviously not a &#039;prediction&#039; as the numbers were not displayed prior to the draw, and how could they have been since they were not known. The ping-pong balls had a minute internal projector installed that could be remotely activated in each ball AFTER each number was drawn to display each number in sequence.</description>

		<description>If you watch the YouTube video at 1:45 the last number (2) has been drawn. It&#039;s not until 2:09 that he makes the big reveal. So his &quot;hidden&quot; assistant had the six numbers in order for 20 seconds and was able to set-up the final stack. Nothing &quot;magic&quot; there.

It&#039;s just another standard parallax and distraction illusion - bit of camera magic to keep us from seeing the assistant. Nothing special and I&#039;m glad I&#039;ve not wasted much more than five minutes looking at it.</description>
