		<description>Social Networks are stupid, I agree with you! I maintained for a long time a Hi5 &amp; a Facebook Profile &amp; someday I realized that It&#039;s just loss of time.. I won&#039;t find my &quot;Dream Woman&quot; inside this virtual world &amp; I can be very well with my friends &amp; without having these Profiles.. I got annoyed that I had people as &quot;friends&quot; from my College that in the REAL world we didn&#039;t knew each other... That sucks! I freed myself from these and am very happy now.. Now I prefer on my &quot;online&quot; time to deal with my College&#039;s Forum as I&#039;m a Moderator to it.. It has much more fun because I don&#039;t give my personal details to people that I don&#039;t want to. My friends know me! ;)

		<description>I think the key word is &quot;social&quot; in Social networking. ;)

But I think primarily the use of the networks are subjective to the one who wants to participate in the network.

some, such as you would look to find a like minded people. Social networks would only be &quot;stupid&quot; if they did not fulfill the intended purpose of joining the network. If someone has not gained or benefited from the network. It has wasted life and then become a stupid and fruitless venture. 

and true,

by &quot;buying&quot; into a third party network you sell your privacy on some level to a &quot;system that collects&quot; but following that logic you would have to say the entire Internet can be classified as &quot;stupid&quot;</description>

		<description>I hope I haven&#039;t missunderstood your entry, but I think people just like the opportunity to have another life where they try to be what they think they should be, just look at second life, it&#039;s the same as social networks. the web just dont give the opportunities to rebuilt your whole identity yet and if you wanna &#039;socialize&#039; with someone you have to look at the whole person.</description>

		<description>you, English is not my native language but you are apparently illiterate. The last paragraph is in 3rd person but I guess there is no point explaining that now. moreover, your comment is completely irrelevant as you cannot stick behind your words, posting anonymously. so what&#039;s your real point/agenda, you?</description>

		<description>Right now you and me are in a social network if you think about it. And the medium of communications is the Web. Why subdividing and emulating that? Every single social network asks you to store data that they wont give it back to you. What&#039;s the point? I like to refer to the human race as social butterflies. We simply jump from one Data Hive to another. Why don&#039;t we enable that? OpenID is a good start, although security-wise it may introduce new challenges.</description>

		<description>i agree with you! and want to add that i was invited a few times to social networks, and when i asked - &quot;for what reason? what it will give me?&quot; - inviter didn&#039;t answer anything! really, if someone know what soc.net can give - please - tell me? but i think that for *market-people* it can give very good *market sector*... well, if you want to sell something - you need to find people interested in that *something*.. so you look for social network related to *something* and... ;-)
blah blah..

pdp, my respects to you, &#039;cos you are not only &quot;my only interest is computer&quot;, and it is good example that hacking is not only computer-related topic. stay tuned!</description>
