		<description>I agree that Twitter is about branding, but isn&#039;t all social interaction?

I don&#039;t see blogs and Twitter as all that different; Twitter is basically an extension of your main site, which is also largely about personal branding.

So yes, Twitter is about ego and branding, but so is blogging, using mailing lists, or any other form of thrusting your ideas out in front of other people with the desire to discuss them or get questions answered.

All three mediums have the ability to be valuable tools for solving problems or answering questions, or can end up being social drivel. There&#039;s very little difference.</description>

		<description>true :) I think that in general, just because Twitter supports SMS updates, it is a really good broadcast tool. it should serve well for updates in case of emergency, etc.</description>

		<description>Or you can use it to remote control the lights of a Xmas tree. There&#039;s some value into building that ;-)
