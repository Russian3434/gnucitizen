		<description>frisky?, I think this &quot;life, work separation&quot; thing is nonsense. your life is your work and your work is your life. it may sound wrong at first but I am sure that you can get what I mean. if you start separating what you do from what you want to do then you are totally off track and you should change jobs, in general of course.

on the other note, I must agree with you. working from home is soooooo much more productive. the thing is that your body cannot be productive all the time and not necessarily from 9 to 5. in this time frame humans are as productive as 20% probably. however, if you can sense the right time when you feel like doing work then you can be 100% productive for very short period of time which in overall is more productive.

however, I don&#039;t think that everyone is suited for this type of job. I believe that people who are in general happy with their job can work from home as they will do what they do anyway when they are not working. I am not sure if I make any sense. :)</description>

		<description>interesting... 

although i find that i dont really need a defined workspace to get work done.  I actually &#039;work from home&#039; about 90% of the time, going into the office only for some meetings from time to time... I find that I actually get more done from home than at the office now.  

Although Im lucky to be able to work from anywhere, it does have its negatives: since I dont have a &quot;9-5&quot; job - Im ALWAYS on - always thinking of work, always in work mode... its not unusual for me to think of that solution for a code-bug at 4am and get right up from bed and actually implement it. HAH.
